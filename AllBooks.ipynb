       "['The Angel of the Odd: An Extravaganza   IT was a chilly November afternoon',\n",
       " ' I had just consummated an unusually hearty dinner, of which the dyspeptic truffe formed not the least important item, and was sitting alone in the dining-room, with my feet upon the fender, and at my elbow a small table which I had rolled up to the fire, and upon which were some apologies for dessert, with some miscellaneous bottles of wine, spirit and liqueur',\n",
       " ' In the morning I had been reading Glover\\'s \"Leonidas,\" Wilkie\\'s \"Epigoniad,\" Lamartine\\'s \"Pilgrimage,\" Barlow\\'s \"Columbiad,\" Tuckermann\\'s \"Sicily,\" and Griswold\\'s \"Curiosities\" ; I am willing to confess, therefore, that I now felt a little stupid',\n",
       " ' I made effort to arouse myself by aid of frequent Lafitte, and, all failing, I betook myself to a stray newspaper in despair',\n",
       " ' Having carefully perused the column of \"houses to let,\" and the column of \"dogs lost,\" and then the two columns of \"wives and apprentices runaway,\" I attacked with great resolution the editorial matter, and, reading it from beginning to end without understanding a syllable, conceived the possibility of its being Chinese, and so re-read it from the end to the beginning, but with no more satisfactory result',\n",
       " ' I was about throwing away, in disgust,  \"This           folio              of     four          pages,          happy           work Which not even critics criticise,\"  when I felt my attention somewhat aroused by the paragraph which follows :     \"The avenues to death are numerous and strange',\n",
       " ' A London paper mentions the decease of a person from a singular cause',\n",
       " \" He was playing at 'puff the dart,' which is played with a long needle inserted in some worsted, and blown at a target through a tin tube\",\n",
       " ' He placed the needle at the wrong end of the tube, and drawing his breath strongly to puff the dart forward with force, drew the needle into his throat',\n",
       " ' It entered the lungs, and in a few days killed him',\n",
       " '\"     Upon seeing this I fell into a great rage, without exactly knowing why',\n",
       " ' \"This thing,\" I exclaimed, \"is a contemptible falsehood --- a poor hoax --- the lees of the invention of some pitiable penny-a-liner --- of some wretched concoctor of accidents in Cocaigne',\n",
       " ' These fellows, knowing the extravagant gullibility of the age, set their wits to work in the imagination of improbable possibilities --- of odd accidents, as they term them; but to a reflecting intellect (like mine,\" I added, in parenthesis, putting my forefinger unconsciously to the side of my nose), \"to a contemplative understanding such as I myself possess, it seems evident at once that the marvelous increase of late in these \\'odd accidents\\' is by far the oddest accident of all',\n",
       " \" For my own part, I intend to believe nothing henceforward that has anything of the 'singular' about it\",\n",
       " '\" \\x0c   \"Mein Gott, den, vat a vool you bees for dat',\n",
       " '\" replied one of the most remarkable voices I ever heard',\n",
       " ' At first I took it for a rumbling in my ears --- such as a man sometimes experiences when getting very drunk --- but, upon second thought, I considered the sound as more nearly resembling that which proceeds from an empty barrel beaten with a big stick; and, in fact, this I should have concluded it to be, but for the articulation of the syllables and words',\n",
       " ' I am by no means naturally nervous, and the very few glasses of Lafitte which I had sipped served to embolden me no little, so that I felt nothing of trepidation, but merely uplifted my eyes with a leisurely movement, and looked carefully around the room for the intruder',\n",
       " ' I could not, however, perceive any one at all',\n",
       " '     \"Humph',\n",
       " '\" resumed the voice, as I continued my survey, \"you mus pe so dronk as de pig, den, for not zee me as I zit here at your zide',\n",
       " '\"     Hereupon I bethought me of looking immediately before my nose, and there, sure enough, confronting me at the table sat a personage nondescript, although not altogether indescribable',\n",
       " ' His body was a wine-pipe, or a rum-puncheon, or something of that character, and had a truly Falstaffian air',\n",
       " ' In its nether extremity were inserted two kegs, which seemed to answer all the purposes of legs',\n",
       " ' For arms there dangled from the upper portion of the carcass two tolerably long bottles, with the necks outward for hands',\n",
       " ' All the head that I saw the monster possessed of was one of those Hessian canteens which resemble a large snuff-box with a hole in the middle of the lid',\n",
       " ' This canteen (with a funnel on its top, like a cavalier cap slouched over the eyes) was set on edge upon the puncheon, with the hole toward myself; and through this hole, which seemed puckered up like the mouth of a very precise old maid, the creature was emitting certain rumbling and grumbling noises which he evidently intended for intelligible talk',\n",
       " '    \"I zay,\" said he, \"you mos pe dronk as de pig, vor zit dare and not zee me zit ere; and I zay, doo, you mos pe pigger vool as de goose, vor to dispelief vat iz print in de print',\n",
       " \" 'Tiz de troof --- dat it iz --- eberry vord ob it\",\n",
       " '\"    \"Who are you, pray',\n",
       " '\" said I, with much dignity, although somewhat puzzled; \"how did you get here',\n",
       " ' and what is it you are talking about',\n",
       " '\"    \"Az vor ow I com\\'d ere,\" replied the figure, \"dat iz none of your pizzness; and as vor vat I be talking apout, I be talk apout vat I tink proper; and as vor who I be, vy dat is de very ting I com\\'d here for to let you zee for yourzelf',\n",
       " '\"     \"You are a drunken vagabond,\" said I, \"and I shall ring the bell and order my footman to kick you into the street',\n",
       " '\"    \"He',\n",
       " ' he',\n",
       " ' he',\n",
       " '\" said the fellow, \"hu',\n",
       " ' hu',\n",
       " ' hu',\n",
       " \" dat you can't do\",\n",
       " '\"    \"Can\\'t do',\n",
       " '\" said I, \"what do you mean',\n",
       " \" --- I can't do what\",\n",
       " '\" \\x0c \"Ring de pell ;\" he replied, attempting a grin with his little villainous mouth',\n",
       " '     Upon this I made an effort to get up, in order to put my threat into execution; but the ruffian just reached across the table very deliberately, and hitting me a tap on the forehead with the neck of one of the long bottles, knocked me back into the arm-chair from which I had half arisen',\n",
       " ' I was utterly astounded; and, for a moment, was quite at a loss what to do',\n",
       " ' In the meantime, he continued his talk',\n",
       " '     \"You zee,\" said he, \"it iz te bess vor zit still; and now you shall know who I pe',\n",
       " ' Look at me ',\n",
       " ' zee ',\n",
       " ' I am te Angel ov te Odd',\n",
       " '\"     \"And odd enough, too,\" I ventured to reply; \"but I was always under the impression that an angel had wings',\n",
       " '\"     \"Te wing',\n",
       " '\" he cried, highly incensed, \"vat I pe do mit te wing',\n",
       " ' Mein Gott ',\n",
       " ' do you take me vor a shicken',\n",
       " '\"    \"No --- oh no',\n",
       " '\" I replied, much alarmed, \"you are no chicken --- certainly not',\n",
       " '\"     \"Well, den, zit still and pehabe yourself, or I\\'ll rap you again mid me vist',\n",
       " ' It iz te shicken ab te wing, und te owl ab te wing, und te imp ab te wing, und te head-teuffel ab te wing',\n",
       " ' Te angel ab not te wing, and I am te Angel ov te Odd',\n",
       " '\"    \"And your business with me at present is --- is ---\"    \"My pizzness',\n",
       " '\" ejaculated the thing, \"vy vat a low bred buppy you mos pe vor to ask a gentleman und an angel apout his pizziness',\n",
       " '\"     This language was rather more than I could bear, even from an angel; so, plucking up courage, I seized a salt-cellar which lay within reach, and hurled it at the head of the intruder',\n",
       " ' Either he dodged, however, or my aim was inaccurate; for all I accomplished was the demolition of the crystal which protected the dial of the clock upon the mantel- piece',\n",
       " ' As for the Angel, he evinced his sense of my assault by giving me two or three hard consecutive raps upon the forehead as before',\n",
       " ' These reduced me at once to submission, and I am almost ashamed to confess that either through pain or vexation, there came a few tears into my eyes',\n",
       " '    \"Mein Gott',\n",
       " '\" said the Angel of the Odd, apparently much softened at my distress; \"mein Gott, te man is eder ferry dronk or ferry zorry',\n",
       " ' You mos not trink it so strong --- you mos put te water in te wine',\n",
       " \" Here, trink dis, like a goot veller, und don't gry now --- don't\",\n",
       " '\"     Hereupon the Angel of the Odd replenished my goblet (which was about a third full of Port) with a colorless fluid that he poured from one of his hand bottles',\n",
       " ' I observed that these bottles had labels about their necks, and that these labels were inscribed \"Kirschenwasser',\n",
       " '\" \\x0c   The considerate kindness of the Angel mollified me in no little measure; and, aided by the water with which he diluted my Port more than once, I at length regained sufficient temper to listen to his very extraordinary discourse',\n",
       " ' I cannot pretend to recount all that he told me, but I gleaned from what he said that he was the genius who presided over the contretemps of mankind, and whose business it was to bring about the odd accidents which are continually astonishing the skeptic',\n",
       " ' Once or twice, upon my venturing to express my total incredulity in respect to his pretensions, he grew very angry indeed, so that at length I considered it the wiser policy to say nothing at all, and let him have his own way',\n",
       " ' He talked on, therefore, at great length, while I merely leaned back in my chair with my eyes shut, and amused myself with munching raisins and filliping the stems about the room',\n",
       " ' But, by-and-by, the Angel suddenly construed this behavior of mine into contempt',\n",
       " ' He arose in a terrible passion, slouched his funnel down over his eyes, swore a vast oath, uttered a threat of some character which I did not precisely comprehend, and finally made me a low bow and departed, wishing me, in the language of the archbishop in Gil-Blas, \"beaucoup de bonheur et un peu plus de bon sens',\n",
       " '\"     His departure afforded me relief',\n",
       " ' The very few glasses of Lafitte that I had sipped had the effect of rendering me drowsy, and I felt inclined to take a nap of some fifteen or twenty minutes, as is my custom after dinner',\n",
       " ' At six I had an appointment of consequence, which it was quite indispensable that I should keep',\n",
       " ' The policy of insurance for my dwelling house had expired the day before; and, some dispute having arisen, it was agreed that, at six, I should meet the board of directors of the company and settle the terms of a renewal',\n",
       " ' Glancing upward at the clock on the mantel-piece, (for I felt too drowsy to take out my watch), I had the pleasure to find that I had still twenty- five minutes to spare',\n",
       " ' It was half past five; I could easily walk to the insurance office in five minutes; and my usual siestas had never been known to exceed five and twenty',\n",
       " ' I felt sufficiently safe, therefore, and composed myself to my slumbers forthwith',\n",
       " '      Having completed them to my satisfaction, I again looked toward the time-piece and was half inclined to believe in the possibility of odd accidents when I found that, instead of my ordinary fifteen or twenty minutes, I had been dozing only three; for it still wanted seven and twenty of the appointed hour',\n",
       " ' I betook myself again to my nap, and at length a second time awoke, when, to my utter amazement, it still wanted twenty-seven minutes of six',\n",
       " ' I jumped up to examine the clock, and found that it had ceased running',\n",
       " ' My watch informed me that it was half past seven; and, of course, having slept two hours, I was too late for my appointment',\n",
       " ' \"It will make no difference,\" I said : \"I can call at the office in the morning and apologize; in the meantime what can be the matter with the clock ',\n",
       " '\" Upon examining it I discovered that one of the raisin stems which I had been filliping about the room during the discourse of the Angel of the Odd, had flown through the fractured crystal, and lodging, singularly enough, in the key-hole, with an end projecting outward, had thus arrested the revolution of the minute hand',\n",
       " '    \"Ah',\n",
       " '\" said I, \"I see how it is',\n",
       " ' This thing speaks for itself',\n",
       " ' A natural accident, such as will happen now and then',\n",
       " '\" \\x0c   I gave the matter no further consideration, and at my usual hour retired to bed',\n",
       " ' Here, having placed a candle upon a reading stand at the bed head, and having made an attempt to peruse some pages of the \"Omnipresence of the Deity,\" I unfortunately fell asleep in less than twenty seconds, leaving the light burning as it was',\n",
       " '     My dreams were terrifically disturbed by visions of the Angel of the Odd',\n",
       " ' Methought he stood at the foot of the couch, drew aside the curtains, and, in the hollow, detestable tones of a rum puncheon, menaced me with the bitterest vengeance for the contempt with which I had treated him',\n",
       " ' He concluded a long harangue by taking off his funnel-cap, inserting the tube into my gullet, and thus deluging me with an ocean of Kirschenw\\xc3\\xa4sser, which he poured, in a continuous flood, from one of the long necked bottles that stood him instead of an arm',\n",
       " ' My agony was at length insufferable, and I awoke just in time to perceive that a rat had ran off with the lighted candle from the stand, but not in season to prevent his making his escape with it through the hole',\n",
       " ' Very soon, a strong suffocating odor assailed my nostrils; the house, I clearly perceived, was on fire',\n",
       " ' In a few minutes the blaze broke forth with violence, and in an incredibly brief period the entire building was wrapped in flames',\n",
       " ' All egress from my chamber, except through a window, was cut off',\n",
       " ' The crowd, however, quickly procured and raised a long ladder',\n",
       " ' By means of this I was descending rapidly, and in apparent safety, when a huge hog, about whose rotund stomach, and indeed about whose whole air and physiognomy, there was something which reminded me of the Angel of the Odd, --- when this hog, I say, which hitherto had been quietly slumbering in the mud, took it suddenly into his head that his left shoulder needed scratching, and could find no more convenient rubbing-post than that afforded by the foot of the ladder',\n",
       " ' In an instant I was precipitated and had the misfortune to fracture my arm',\n",
       " '     This accident, with the loss of my insurance, and with the more serious loss of my hair, --- the whole of which had been singed off by the fire,--- predisposed me to serious impressions, so that, finally, I made up my mind to take a wife',\n",
       " ' There was a rich widow disconsolate for the loss of her seventh husband, and to her wounded spirit I offered the balm of my vows',\n",
       " ' She yielded a reluctant consent to my prayers',\n",
       " ' I knelt at her feet in gratitude and adoration',\n",
       " ' She blushed and bowed her luxuriant tresses into close contact with those supplied me, temporarily, by Grandjean',\n",
       " ' I know not how the entanglement took place, but so it was',\n",
       " ' I arose with a shining pate, wigless ; she in disdain and wrath, half buried in alien hair',\n",
       " ' Thus ended my hopes of the widow by an accident which could not have been anticipated, to be sure, but which the natural sequence of events had brought about',\n",
       " '     Without despairing, however, I undertook the siege of a less implacable heart',\n",
       " ' The fates were again propitious for a brief period; but again a trivial incident interfered',\n",
       " ' Meeting my betrothed in an avenue thronged with the \\xc3\\xa9lite of the city, I was hastening to greet her with one of my best considered bows, when a small particle of some foreign matter, lodging in the corner of my eye, rendered me, for the moment, completely blind',\n",
       " ' Before I could recover my sight, the lady of my love had disappeared --- irreparably affronted at what she chose to consider my premeditated rudeness in passing her by ungreeted',\n",
       " ' While I stood bewildered at the suddenness of this accident, (which might \\x0chave happened, nevertheless, to any one under the sun), and while I still continued incapable of sight, I was accosted by the Angel of the Odd, who proffered me his aid with a civility which I had no reason to expect',\n",
       " ' He examined my disordered eye with much gentleness and skill, informed me that I had a drop in it, and (whatever a \"drop\" was) took it out, and afforded me relief',\n",
       " '  I now considered it high time to die, (since fortune had so determined to persecute me,) and accordingly made my way to the nearest river',\n",
       " ' Here, divesting myself of my clothes, (for there is no reason why we cannot die as we were born), I threw myself headlong into the current; the sole witness of my fate being a solitary crow that had been seduced into the eating of brandy-saturated corn, and so had staggered away from his fellows',\n",
       " ' No sooner had I entered the water than this bird took it into its head to fly away with the most indispensable portion of my apparel',\n",
       " ' Postponing, therefore, for the present, my suicidal design, I just slipped my nether extremities into the sleeves of my coat, and betook myself to a pursuit of the felon with all the nimbleness which the case required and its circumstances would admit',\n",
       " ' But my evil destiny attended me still',\n",
       " ' As I ran at full speed, with my nose up in the atmosphere, and intent only upon the purloiner of my property, I suddenly perceived that my feet rested no longer upon terra-firma; the fact is, I had thrown myself over a precipice, and should inevitably have been dashed to pieces but for my good fortune in grasping the end of a long guide-rope, which depended from a passing balloon',\n",
       " '     As soon as I sufficiently recovered my senses to comprehend the terrific predicament in which I stood or rather hung, I exerted all the power of my lungs to make that predicament known to the \\xc3\\xa6ronaut overhead',\n",
       " ' But for a long time I exerted myself in vain',\n",
       " ' Either the fool could not, or the villain would not perceive me',\n",
       " ' Meantime the machine rapidly soared, while my strength even more rapidly failed',\n",
       " ' I was soon upon the point of resigning myself to my fate, and dropping quietly into the sea, when my spirits were suddenly revived by hearing a hollow voice from above, which seemed to be lazily humming an opera air',\n",
       " ' Looking up, I perceived the Angel of the Odd',\n",
       " ' He was leaning with his arms folded, over the rim of the car ; and with a pipe in his mouth, at which he puffed leisurely, seemed to be upon excellent terms with himself and the universe',\n",
       " ' I was too much exhausted to speak, so I merely regarded him with an imploring air',\n",
       " '    For several minutes, although he looked me full in the face, he said nothing',\n",
       " ' At length removing carefully his meerschaum from the right to the left corner of his mouth, he condescended to speak',\n",
       " '    \"Who pe you,\" he asked, \"und what der teuffel you pe do dare',\n",
       " '\"     To this piece of impudence, cruelty and affectation, I could reply only by ejaculating the monosyllable \"Help',\n",
       " '\"    \"Elp',\n",
       " '\" echoed the ruffian --- \"not I',\n",
       " \" Dare iz te pottle --- elp yourself, und pe tam'd \",\n",
       " '\" \\x0c    With these words he let fall a heavy bottle of Kirschenwasser which, dropping precisely upon the crown of my head, caused me to imagine that my brains were entirely knocked out',\n",
       " ' Impressed with this idea, I was about to relinquish my hold and give up the ghost with a good grace, when I was arrested by the cry of the Angel, who bade me hold on',\n",
       " '    \"Old on',\n",
       " '\" he said; \"don\\'t pe in te urry --- don\\'t',\n",
       " ' Will you pe take de odder pottle, or ave you pe got zober yet and come to your zenzes',\n",
       " '\"     I made haste, hereupon, to nod my head twice --- once in the negative, meaning thereby that I would prefer not taking the other bottle at present --- and once in the affirmative, intending thus to imply that I was sober and had positively come to my senses',\n",
       " ' By these means I somewhat softened the Angel',\n",
       " '    \"Und you pelief, ten,\" he inquired, \"at te last',\n",
       " ' You pelief, ten, in te possibilty of te odd',\n",
       " '\"    I again nodded my head in assent',\n",
       " '    \"Und you ave pelief in me, te Angel of te Odd',\n",
       " '\"    I nodded again',\n",
       " '    \"Und you acknowledge tat you pe te blind dronk and te vool',\n",
       " '\"    I nodded once more',\n",
       " '    \"Put your right hand into your left hand preeches pocket, ten, in token ov your vull zubmizzion unto te Angel ov te Odd',\n",
       " '\"     This thing, for very obvious reasons, I found it quite impossible to do',\n",
       " ' In the first place, my left arm had been broken in my fall from the ladder, and, therefore, had I let go my hold with the right hand, I must have let go altogether',\n",
       " ' In the second place, I could have no breeches until I came across the crow',\n",
       " ' I was therefore obliged, much to my regret, to shake my head in the negative --- intending thus to give the Angel to understand that I found it inconvenient, just at that moment, to comply with his very reasonable demand ',\n",
       " ' No sooner, however, had I ceased shaking my head than ---    \"Go to der teuffel, ten',\n",
       " '\" roared the Angel of the Odd',\n",
       " '    In pronouncing these words, he drew a sharp knife across the guide-rope by which I was suspended, and as we then happened to be precisely over my own house, (which, during my peregrinations, had been handsomely rebuilt,) it so occurred that I tumbled headlong down the ample chimney and alit upon the dining-room hearth',\n",
       " \" \\x0c   Upon coming to my senses, (for the fall had very thoroughly stunned me,) I found it about four o'clock in the morning\",\n",
       " ' I lay outstretched where I had fallen from the balloon',\n",
       " ' My head grovelled in the ashes of an extinguished fire, while my feet reposed upon the wreck of a small table, overthrown, and amid the fragments of a miscellaneous dessert, intermingled with a newspaper, some broken glass and shattered bottles, and an empty jug of the Schiedam Kirschenwasser',\n",
       " ' Thus revenged himself the Angel of the Odd',\n",
       " ' \\x0cThe Assignation   Stay           for           me            there',\n",
       " '            I           will   not      fail',\n",

       " '  [Exequy on the death of his wife, by Henry King, Bishop of Chichester]  ILL-FATED and mysterious man',\n",
       " ' --- bewildered in the brilliancy of thine own imagination, and fallen in the flames of thine own youth',\n",
       " ' Again in fancy I behold thee',\n",
       " ' Once more thy form hath risen before me',\n",
       " ' --- not --- oh',\n",
       " ' not as thou art --- in the cold valley and shadow --- but as thou shouldst be --- squandering away a life of magnificent meditation in that city of dim visions, thine own Venice --- which is a star-beloved Elysium of the sea, and the wide windows of whose Palladian palaces look down with a deep and bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters',\n",
       " ' Yes',\n",
       " ' I repeat it --- as thou shouldst be',\n",
       " ' There are surely other worlds than this --- other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude --- other speculations than the speculations of the sophist',\n",
       " ' Who then shall call thy conduct into question',\n",
       " ' who blame thee for thy visionary hours, or denounce those occupations as a wasting away of life, which were but the overflowings of thine everlasting energies',\n",
       " '    It was at Venice, beneath the covered archway there called the Ponte di Sospiri, that I met for the third or fourth time the person of whom I speak',\n",
       " ' It is with a confused recollection that I bring to mind the circumstances of that meeting',\n",
       " ' Yet I remember --- ah',\n",
       " ' how should I forget',\n",
       " ' --- the deep midnight, the Bridge of Sighs, the beauty of woman, and the Genius of Romance that stalked up and down the narrow canal',\n",
       " '     It was a night of unusual gloom',\n",
       " ' The great clock of the Piazza had sounded the fifth hour of the Italian evening',\n",
       " ' The square of the Campanile lay silent and deserted, and the lights in the old Ducal Palace were dying fast away',\n",
       " ' I was returning home from the Piazetta, by way of the Grand Canal',\n",
       " ' But as my gondola arrived opposite the mouth of the canal San Marco, a female voice from its recesses broke suddenly upon the night, in one wild, hysterical, and long continued shriek',\n",

       " ' Henson and Sir George Cayley --- had much weakened the public interest in the subject of aerial navigation',\n",
       " ' Mr',\n",
       " \" Henson's scheme (which at first was considered very feasible even by men of science) was founded upon the principle of an inclined plane, started from an eminence by an extrinsic force, applied and continued by the revolution of impinging vanes, in form and number resembling the vanes of a windmill\",\n",
       " ' But, in all the experiments made with models at the Adelaide Gallery, it was found that the operation of these fans not only did not propel the machine, but actually impeded its flight',\n",
       " ' The only propelling force it ever exhibited, was the mere impetus acquired from the descent of the inclined plane; and this impetus carried the machine farther when the vanes were at rest, than when they were in motion -- - a fact which sufficiently demonstrates their inutility; and in the absence of the \\x0cpropelling, which was also the sustaining power, the whole fabric would necessarily descend',\n",
       " ' This consideration led Sir George Cayley to think only of adapting a propeller to some machine having of itself an independent power of support --- in a word, to a balloon; the idea, however, being novel, or original, with Sir George, only so far as regards the mode of its application to practice',\n",
       " ' He exhibited a model of his invention at the Polytechnic Institution',\n",
       " ' The propelling principle, or power, was here, also, applied to interrupted surfaces, or vanes, put in revolution',\n",
       " ' These vanes were four in number, but were found entirely ineffectual in moving the balloon, or in aiding its ascending power',\n",
       " ' The whole project was thus a complete failure',\n",
       " '     It was at this juncture that Mr',\n",
       " ' Monck Mason (whose voyage from Dover to Weilburg in the balloon, \"Nassau,\" occasioned so much excitement in 1837) conceived the idea of employing the principle of the Archimedean screw for the purpose of propulsion through the air --- rightly attributing the failure of Mr',\n",
       " \" Henson's scheme, and of Sir George Cayley's, to the interruption of surface in the independent vanes\",\n",
       " \" He made the first public experiment at Willis's Rooms, but afterward removed his model to the Adelaide Gallery\",\n",
       " \"     Like Sir George Cayley's balloon, his own was an ellipsoid\",\n",
       " ' Its length was thirteen feet six inches --- height, six feet eight inches',\n",
       " ' It contained about three hundred and twenty cubic feet of gas, which, if pure hydrogen, would support twenty-one pounds upon its first inflation, before the gas has time to deteriorate or escape',\n",
       " ' The weight of the whole machine and apparatus was seventeen pounds --- leaving about four pounds to spare',\n",
       " ' Beneath the centre of the balloon, was a frame of light wood, about nine feet long, and rigged on to the balloon itself with a network in the customary manner',\n",
       " ' From this framework was suspended a wicker basket or car',\n",
       " '  The screw consists of an axis of hollow brass tube, eighteen inches in length, through which, upon a semi-spiral inclined at fifteen degrees, pass a series of steel wire radii, two feet long, and thus projecting a foot on either side',\n",
       " ' These radii are connected at the outer extremities by two bands of flattened wire --- the whole in this manner forming the framework of the screw, which is completed by a covering of oiled silk cut into gores, and tightened so as to present a tolerably uniform surface',\n",
       " ' At each end of its axis this screw is supported by pillars of hollow brass tube descending from the hoop',\n",
       " ' In the lower ends of these tubes are holes in which the pivots of the axis revolve',\n",
       " ' From the end of the axis which is next the car, proceeds a shaft of steel, connecting the screw with the pinion of a piece of spring machinery fixed in the car',\n",
       " ' By the operation of this spring, the screw is made to revolve with great rapidity, communicating a progressive motion to the whole',\n",
       " ' By means of the rudder, the machine was readily turned in any direction',\n",
       " ' The spring was of great power, compared with its dimensions, being capable of raising forty- five pounds upon a barrel of four inches diameter, after the first turn, and gradually increasing as it was wound up',\n",
       " ' It weighed, altogether, eight pounds six ounces',\n",
       " ' The rudder was a light frame of cane covered with silk, shaped somewhat like a battledore, and was about three feet long, and at the widest, one foot',\n",
       " ' Its weight was about two ounces',\n",
       " ' It could be turned flat, and directed upwards or downwards, as well as to the right or left; and thus enabled the aeronaut to transfer the resistance of the air which in an \\x0cinclined position it must generate in its passage, to any side upon which he might desire to act ; thus determining the balloon in the opposite direction',\n",
       " '      This model (which, through want of time, we have necessarily described in an imperfect manner) was put in action at the Adelaide Gallery, where it accomplished a velocity of five miles per hour; although, strange to say, it excited very little interest in comparison with the previous complex machine of Mr',\n",

       " ' We are not informed for what reason the two seamen were also included in the party --- but, in the course of a day or two, we shall put our readers in possession of the minutest particulars respecting this extraordinary voyage',\n",
       " '     The balloon is composed of silk, varnished with the liquid gum caoutchouc',\n",
       " ' It is of vast dimensions, containing more than 40,000 cubic feet of gas; but as coal gas was employed in place of the more expensive and inconvenient hydrogen, the supporting power of the machine, when fully inflated, and immediately after inflation, is not more than about 2500 pounds',\n",
       " ' The coal gas is not only much less costly, but is easily procured and managed',\n",
       " '     For its introduction into common use for purposes of aerostation, we are indebted to Mr',\n",
       " ' Charles Green',\n",
       " ' Up to his discovery, the process of inflation was not only exceedingly expensive, but uncertain',\n",
       " ' Two, and even three days, have frequently been wasted in futile attempts to procure a sufficiency of hydrogen to fill a balloon, from which it had great tendency to escape, owing to its extreme subtlety, and its affinity for the surrounding atmosphere',\n",
       " ' In a balloon sufficiently perfect to retain its contents of coal-gas unaltered, in quantity or amount, for six months, an equal quantity of hydrogen could not be maintained in equal purity for six weeks',\n",
       " ' \\x0c   The supporting power being estimated at 2500 pounds, and the united weights of the party amounting only to about 1200, there was left a surplus of 1300, of which again 1200 was exhausted by ballast, arranged in bags of different sizes, with their respective weights marked upon them --- by cordage, barometers, telescopes, barrels containing provision for a fortnight, water-casks, cloaks, carpet-bags, and various other indispensable matters, including a coffee-warmer, contrived for warming coffee by means of slack-lime, so as to dispense altogether with fire, if it should be judged prudent to do so',\n",
       " ' All these articles, with the exception of the ballast, and a few trifles, were suspended from the hoop overhead',\n",
       " ' The car is much smaller and lighter, in proportion, than the one appended to the model',\n",
       " ' It is formed of a light wicker, and is wonderfully strong, for so frail looking a machine',\n",
       " ' Its rim is about four feet deep',\n",
       " ' The rudder is also very much larger, in proportion, than that of the model ; and the screw is considerably smaller',\n",
       " ' The balloon is furnished besides with a grapnel, and a guide-rope ; which latter is of the most indispensable importance',\n",
       " ' A few words, in explanation, will here be necessary for such of our readers as are not conversant with the details of aerostation',\n",
       " '      As soon as the balloon quits the earth, it is subjected to the influence of many circumstances tending to create a difference in its weight; augmenting or diminishing its ascending power',\n",
       " ' For example, there may be a deposition of dew upon the silk, to the extent, even, of several hundred pounds; ballast has then to be thrown out, or the machine may descend',\n",
       " ' This ballast being discarded, and a clear sunshine evaporating the dew, and at the same time expanding the gas in the silk, the whole will again rapidly ascend',\n",
       " ' To check this ascent, the only recourse is, (or rather was, until Mr',\n",
       " \" Green's invention of the guide-rope) the permission of the escape of gas from the valve; but, in the loss of gas, is a proportionate general loss of ascending power; so that, in a comparatively brief period, the best-constructed balloon must necessarily exhaust all its resources, and come to the earth\",\n",
       " ' This was the great obstacle to voyages of length',\n",
       " '     The guide-rope remedies the difficulty in the simplest manner conceivable',\n",
       " ' It is merely a very long rope which is suffered to trail from the car, and the effect of which is to prevent the balloon from changing its level in any material degree',\n",
       " ' If, for example, there should be a deposition of moisture upon the silk, and the machine begins to descend in consequence, there will be no necessity for discharging ballast to remedy the increase of weight, for it is remedied, or counteracted, in an exactly just proportion, by the deposit on the ground of just so much of the end of the rope as is necessary',\n",
       " ' If, on the other hand, any circumstances should cause undue levity, and consequent ascent, this levity is immediately counteracted by the additional weight of rope upraised from the earth',\n",
       " ' Thus, the balloon can neither ascend or descend, except within very narrow limits, and its resources, either in gas or ballast, remain comparatively unimpaired',\n",
       " ' When passing over an expanse of water, it becomes necessary to employ small kegs of copper or wood, filled with liquid ballast of a lighter nature than water',\n",
       " ' These float, and serve all the purposes of a mere rope on land',\n",
       " ' Another most important office of the guide-rope, is to point out the direction of the balloon',\n",
       " ' The rope drags, either on land or sea, while the balloon is free ; the latter, consequently, is always in advance, when any progress whatever is made \\x0c: a comparison, therefore, by means of the compass, of the relative positions of the two objects, will always indicate the course',\n",
       " ' In the same way, the angle formed by the rope with the vertical axis of the machine, indicates the velocity',\n",
       " ' When there is no angle --- in other words, when the rope hangs perpendicularly, the whole apparatus is stationary ; but the larger the angle, that is to say, the farther the balloon precedes the end of the rope, the greater the velocity; and the converse',\n",
       " '     As the original design was to cross the British Channel, and alight as near Paris as possible, the voyagers had taken the precaution to prepare themselves with passports directed to all parts of the Continent, specifying the nature of the expedition, as in the case of the Nassau voyage, and entitling the adventurers to exemption from the usual formalities of office : unexpected events, however, rendered these passports superfluous',\n",
       " '     The inflation was commenced very quietly at daybreak, on Saturday morning, the 6th instant, in the Court-Yard of Weal-Vor House, Mr',\n",
       " \" Osborne's seat, about a mile from Penstruthal, in North Wales; and at 7 minutes past 11, every thing being ready for departure, the balloon was set free, rising gently but steadily, in a direction nearly South; no use being made, for the first half hour, of either the screw or the rudder\",\n",

       " \" --- Every preparation likely to embarrass us, having been made over night, we commenced the inflation this morning at daybreak; but owing to a thick fog, which encumbered the folds of the silk and rendered it unmanageable, we did not get through before nearly eleven o'clock\",\n",
       " ' Cut loose, then, in high spirits, and rose gently but steadily, with a light breeze at North, which bore us in the direction of the Bristol Channel',\n",
       " \" Found the ascending force greater than we had expected ; and as we arose higher and so got clear of the cliffs, and more in the sun's rays, our ascent became very rapid\",\n",
       " ' I did not wish, however, to lose gas at so early a period of the adventure, and so concluded to ascend for the present',\n",
       " ' We soon ran out our guide-rope; but even when we had raised it clear of the earth, we still went up very rapidly',\n",
       " ' The balloon was unusually steady, and looked beautifully',\n",
       " ' In about ten minutes after starting, the barometer indicated an altitude of 15,000 feet',\n",
       " ' The weather was remarkably fine, and the view of the subjacent country --- a most romantic one when seen from any point, --- was now especially sublime',\n",
       " ' The numerous deep gorges presented the appearance of lakes, on account of the dense vapors with which they were filled, and the pinnacles and crags to the South East, piled in inextricable confusion, resembling nothing so much as the giant cities of eastern fable',\n",
       " ' We were rapidly approaching the mountains in the South ; but our elevation was more than sufficient to enable us to pass them in safety',\n",
       " ' In a few minutes \\x0cwe soared over them in fine style; and Mr',\n",
       " ' Ainsworth, with the seamen, was surprised at their apparent want of altitude when viewed from the car, the tendency of great elevation in a balloon being to reduce inequalities of the surface below, to nearly a dead level',\n",
       " ' At half-past eleven still proceeding nearly South, we obtained our first view of the Bristol Channel; and, in fifteen minutes afterward, the line of breakers on the coast appeared immediately beneath us, and we were fairly out at sea',\n",
       " ' We now resolved to let off enough gas to bring our guide-rope, with the buoys affixed, into the water',\n",
       " ' This was immediately done, and we commenced a gradual descent',\n",
       " ' In about twenty minutes our first buoy dipped, and at the touch of the second soon afterwards, we remained stationary as to elevation',\n",
       " ' We were all now anxious to test the efficiency of the rudder and screw, and we put them both into requisition forthwith, for the purpose of altering our direction more to the eastward, and in a line for Paris',\n",
       " ' By means of the rudder we instantly effected the necessary change of direction, and our course was brought nearly at right angles to that of the wind; when we set in motion the spring of the screw, and were rejoiced to find it propel us readily as desired',\n",
       " ' Upon this we gave nine hearty cheers, and dropped in the sea a bottle, enclosing a slip of parchment with a brief account of the principle of the invention',\n",
       " ' Hardly, however, had we done with our rejoicings, when an unforeseen accident occurred which discouraged us in no little degree',\n",
       " ' The steel rod connecting the spring with the propeller was suddenly jerked out of place, at the car end, (by a swaying of the car through some movement of one of the two seamen we had taken up) and in an instant hung dangling out of reach, from the pivot of the axis of the screw',\n",
       " ' While we were endeavoring to regain it, our attention being completely absorbed, we became involved in a strong current of wind from the East, which bore us, with rapidly increasing force, towards the Atlantic',\n",
       " ' We soon found ourselves driving out to sea at the rate of not less, certainly, than fifty or sixty miles an hour, so that we came up with Cape Clear, at some forty miles to our North, before we had secured the rod, and had time to think what we were about',\n",
       " ' It was now that Mr',\n",

       " ': that we should take advantage of the strong gale which bore us on, and in place of beating back to Paris, make an attempt to reach the coast of North America',\n",
       " ' After slight reflection I gave a willing assent to this bold proposition, which (strange to say) met with objection from the two seamen only',\n",
       " ' As the stronger party, however, we overruled their fears, and kept resolutely upon our course',\n",
       " ' We steered due West; but as the trailing of the buoys materially impeded our progress, and we had the balloon abundantly at command, either for ascent or descent, we first threw out fifty pounds of ballast, and then wound up (by means of a windlass) so much of the rope as brought it quite clear of the sea',\n",

       " ' Men of broader intellect know that there is no sharp distinction betwixt the real and the unreal; that all things appear as they do only by virtue of the delicate individual physical and mental media through which we are made conscious of them; but the prosaic materialism of the majority condemns as madness the flashes of super-sight which penetrate the common veil of obvious empiricism',\n",

       " ' I do not think that what I read in these books or saw in these fields and groves was exactly what other boys read and saw there; but of this I must say little, since detailed speech would but confirm those cruel slanders upon my intellect which I sometimes overhear from the whispers of the stealthy attendants around me',\n",
       " ' It is sufficient for me to relate events without analysing causes',\n",
       " ' I have said that I dwelt apart from the visible world, but I have not said that I dwelt alone',\n",
       " ' This no human creature may do; for lacking the fellowship of the living, he inevitably draws upon the companionship of things that are not, or are no longer, living',\n",
       " ' Close by my home there lies a singular wooded hollow, in whose twilight deeps I spent most of my time; reading, thinking, and dreaming',\n",
       " ' Down its moss-covered slopes my first steps of infancy were taken, and around its grotesquely gnarled oak trees my first fancies of boyhood were woven',\n",
       " ' Well did I come to know the presiding dryads of those trees, and often have I watched their wild dances in the struggling beams of a waning moon\\xe2\\x80\\x94but of these things I must not now speak',\n",
       " ' I will tell only of the lone tomb in the darkest of the hillside thickets; the deserted tomb of the Hydes, an old and exalted family whose last direct descendant had been laid within its black recesses many decades before my birth',\n",
       " ' The vault to which I refer is of ancient granite, weathered and discoloured by the mists and dampness of generations',\n",
       " ' Excavated back into the hillside, the structure is visible only at the entrance',\n",
       " ' The door, a ponderous and forbidding slab of stone, hangs upon rusted iron hinges, and is fastened ajar in a queerly sinister way by means of heavy iron chains and padlocks, according to a gruesome fashion of half a century ago',\n",
       " ' The abode of the race whose scions are here inurned had once crowned the declivity which holds the tomb, but had long since fallen victim to the flames which sprang up from a disastrous stroke of lightning',\n",
       " ' Of the midnight storm which destroyed this gloomy mansion, the older inhabitants of the region sometimes speak in hushed and uneasy voices; alluding to what they call \\xe2\\x80\\x95divine wrath\\xe2\\x80\\x96 in a manner that in later years vaguely increased the always strong fascination which I felt for the forest-darkened sepulchre',\n",
       " ' One man only had perished in the fire',\n",
       " ' When the last of the Hydes was buried in this place of shade and stillness, the sad urnful of ashes had come from a \\x0cdistant land; to which the family had repaired when the mansion burned down',\n",
       " ' No one remains to lay flowers before the granite portal, and few care to brave the depressing shadows which seem to linger strangely about the water-worn stones',\n",
       " ' I shall never forget the afternoon when first I stumbled upon the half-hidden house of death',\n",
       " ' It was in mid-summer, when the alchemy of Nature transmutes the sylvan landscape to one vivid and almost homogeneous mass of green; when the senses are well-nigh intoxicated with the surging seas of moist verdure and the subtly indefinable odours of the soil and the vegetation',\n",
       " ' In such surroundings the mind loses its perspective; time and space become trivial and unreal, and echoes of a forgotten prehistoric past beat insistently upon the enthralled consciousness',\n",
       " ' All day I had been wandering through the mystic groves of the hollow; thinking thoughts I need not discuss, and conversing with things I need not name',\n",
       " ' In years a child of ten, I had seen and heard many wonders unknown to the throng; and was oddly aged in certain respects',\n",
       " ' When, upon forcing my way between two savage clumps of briers, I suddenly encountered the entrance of the vault, I had no knowledge of what I had discovered',\n",
       " ' The dark blocks of granite, the door so curiously ajar, and the funereal carvings above the arch, aroused in me no associations of mournful or terrible character',\n",
       " ' Of graves and tombs I knew and imagined much, but had on account of my peculiar temperament been kept from all personal contact with churchyards and cemeteries',\n",
       " ' The strange stone house on the woodland slope was to me only a source of interest and speculation; and its cold, damp interior, into which I vainly peered through the aperture so tantalisingly left, contained for me no hint of death or decay',\n",
       " ' But in that instant of curiosity was born the madly unreasoning desire which has brought me to this hell of confinement',\n",
       " ' Spurred on by a voice which must have come from the hideous soul of the forest, I resolved to enter the beckoning gloom in spite of the ponderous chains which barred my passage',\n",
       " ' In the waning light of day I alternately rattled the rusty impediments with a view to throwing wide the stone door, and essayed to squeeze my slight form through the space already provided; but neither plan met with success',\n",
       " ' At first curious, I was now frantic; and when in the thickening twilight I returned to my home, I had sworn to the hundred gods of the grove that at any cost I would some day force an entrance to the black, chilly depths that seemed calling out to me',\n",
       " ' The physician with the iron-grey beard who comes each day to my room once told a visitor that this decision marked the beginning of a pitiful monomania; but I will leave final judgment to my readers when they shall have learnt all',\n",
       " ' The months following my discovery were spent in futile attempts to force the complicated padlock of the slightly open vault, and in carefully guarded inquiries regarding the nature and history of the structure',\n",
       " ' With the traditionally receptive ears of the small boy, I learned much; though an habitual secretiveness caused me to tell no one of my information or my resolve',\n",
       " ' It is perhaps worth mentioning that I was not at all surprised or terrified on learning of the nature of the vault',\n",
       " ' My rather original ideas regarding life and death had caused me to associate the cold clay with the breathing body in a vague fashion; and I felt that the great and sinister family of the burned-down mansion was in some way represented within the stone space I sought to explore',\n",
       " ' Mumbled tales of the weird rites and godless revels of bygone years in the ancient hall gave to me a new and potent interest in the tomb, before whose door I would sit for hours at a time each day',\n",
       " ' Once I thrust a candle within the nearly closed entrance, but could see nothing save a flight of damp stone steps leading downward',\n",
       " ' The odour of the place repelled yet bewitched me',\n",
       " ' I felt I had known it before, in a past remote beyond all recollection; beyond even my tenancy of the body I now possess',\n",
       " ' \\x0cThe year after I first beheld the tomb, I stumbled upon a worm-eaten translation of Plutarch\\xe2\\x80\\x98s Lives in the book-filled attic of my home',\n",
       " ' Reading the life of Theseus, I was much impressed by that passage telling of the great stone beneath which the boyish hero was to find his tokens of destiny whenever he should become old enough to lift its enormous weight',\n",
       " ' This legend had the effect of dispelling my keenest impatience to enter the vault, for it made me feel that the time was not yet ripe',\n",
       " ' Later, I told myself, I should grow to a strength and ingenuity which might enable me to unfasten the heavily chained door with ease; but until then I would do better by conforming to what seemed the will of Fate',\n",
       " ' Accordingly my watches by the dank portal became less persistent, and much of my time was spent in other though equally strange pursuits',\n",
       " ' I would sometimes rise very quietly in the night, stealing out to walk in those churchyards and places of burial from which I had been kept by my parents',\n",
       " ' What I did there I may not say, for I am not now sure of the reality of certain things; but I know that on the day after such a nocturnal ramble I would often astonish those about me with my knowledge of topics almost forgotten for many generations',\n",
       " ' It was after a night like this that I shocked the community with a queer conceit about the burial of the rich and celebrated Squire Brewster, a maker of local history who was interred in 1711, and whose slate headstone, bearing a graven skull and crossbones, was slowly crumbling to powder',\n",
       " ' In a moment of childish imagination I vowed not only that the undertaker, Goodman Simpson, had stolen the silver-buckled shoes, silken hose, and satin small-clothes of the deceased before burial; but that the Squire himself, not fully inanimate, had turned twice in his mound-covered coffin on the day after interment',\n",
       " ' But the idea of entering the tomb never left my thoughts; being indeed stimulated by the unexpected genealogical discovery that my own maternal ancestry possessed at least a slight link with the supposedly extinct family of the Hydes',\n",
       " ' Last of my paternal race, I was likewise the last of this older and more mysterious line',\n",
       " ' I began to feel that the tomb was mine, and to look forward with hot eagerness to the time when I might pass within that stone door and down those slimy stone steps in the dark',\n",
       " ' I now formed the habit of listening very intently at the slightly open portal, choosing my favourite hours of midnight stillness for the odd vigil',\n",
       " ' By the time I came of age, I had made a small clearing in the thicket before the mould-stained facade of the hillside, allowing the surrounding vegetation to encircle and overhang the space like the walls and roof of a sylvan bower',\n",
       " ' This bower was my temple, the fastened door my shrine, and here I would lie outstretched on the mossy ground, thinking strange thoughts and dreaming strange dreams',\n",
       " ' The night of the first revelation was a sultry one',\n",
       " ' I must have fallen asleep from fatigue, for it was with a distinct sense of awakening that I heard the voices',\n",
       " ' Of those tones and accents I hesitate to speak; of their quality I will not speak; but I may say that they presented certain uncanny differences in vocabulary, pronunciation, and mode of utterance',\n",
       " ' Every shade of New England dialect, from the uncouth syllables of the Puritan colonists to the precise rhetoric of fifty years ago, seemed represented in that shadowy colloquy, though it was only later that I noticed the fact',\n",
       " ' At the time, indeed, my attention was distracted from this matter by another phenomenon; a phenomenon so fleeting that I could not take oath upon its reality',\n",
       " ' I barely fancied that as I awoke, a light had been hurriedly extinguished within the sunken sepulchre',\n",
       " ' I do not think I was either astounded or panic-stricken, but I know that I was greatly and permanently changed that night',\n",
       " ' Upon returning home I went with much directness to a rotting chest in the attic, wherein I found the key which next day unlocked with ease the barrier I had so long stormed in vain',\n",
       " ' \\x0cIt was in the soft glow of late afternoon that I first entered the vault on the abandoned slope',\n",
       " ' A spell was upon me, and my heart leaped with an exultation I can but ill describe',\n",
       " ' As I closed the door behind me and descended the dripping steps by the light of my lone candle, I seemed to know the way; and though the candle sputtered with the stifling reek of the place, I felt singularly at home in the musty, charnel-house air',\n",
       " ' Looking about me, I beheld many marble slabs bearing coffins, or the remains of coffins',\n",
       " ' Some of these were sealed and intact, but others had nearly vanished, leaving the silver handles and plates isolated amidst certain curious heaps of whitish dust',\n",
       " ' Upon one plate I read the name of Sir Geoffrey Hyde, who had come from Sussex in 1640 and died here a few years later',\n",
       " ' In a conspicuous alcove was one fairly well-preserved and untenanted casket, adorned with a single name which brought to me both a smile and a shudder',\n",
       " ' An odd impulse caused me to climb upon the broad slab, extinguish my candle, and lie down within the vacant box',\n",
       " ' In the grey light of dawn I staggered from the vault and locked the chain of the door behind me',\n",
       " ' I was no longer a young man, though but twenty-one winters had chilled my bodily frame',\n",
       " ' Early-rising villagers who observed my homeward progress looked at me strangely, and marvelled at the signs of ribald revelry which they saw in one whose life was known to be sober and solitary',\n",
       " ' I did not appear before my parents till after a long and refreshing sleep',\n",
       " ' Henceforward I haunted the tomb each night; seeing, hearing, and doing things I must never reveal',\n",
       " ' My speech, always susceptible to environmental influences, was the first thing to succumb to the change; and my suddenly acquired archaism of diction was soon remarked upon',\n",
       " ' Later a queer boldness and recklessness came into my demeanour, till I unconsciously grew to possess the bearing of a man of the world despite my lifelong seclusion',\n",
       " ' My formerly silent tongue waxed voluble with the easy grace of a Chesterfield or the godless cynicism of a Rochester',\n",
       " ' I displayed a peculiar erudition utterly unlike the fantastic, monkish lore over which I had pored in youth; and covered the flyleaves of my books with facile impromptu epigrams which brought up suggestions of Gay, Prior, and the sprightliest of the Augustan wits and rimesters',\n",
       " ' One morning at breakfast I came close to disaster by declaiming in palpably liquorish accents an effusion of eighteenth-century Bacchanalian mirth; a bit of Georgian playfulness never recorded in a book, which ran something like this:      Come hither, my lads, with your tankards of ale,      And drink to the present before it shall fail;      Pile each on your platter a mountain of beef,      For \\xe2\\x80\\x98tis eating and drinking that bring us relief:       So fill up your glass,      For life will soon pass;      When you\\xe2\\x80\\x98re dead ye\\xe2\\x80\\x98ll ne\\xe2\\x80\\x98er drink to your king or your lass',\n",

       " ' \\x0c     Young Harry, propp\\xe2\\x80\\x98d up just as straight as he\\xe2\\x80\\x98s able,      Will soon lose his wig and slip under the table;      But fill up your goblets and pass \\xe2\\x80\\x98em around\\xe2\\x80\\x94      Better under the table than under the ground',\n",
       " '      So revel and chaff      As ye thirstily quaff:      Under six feet of dirt \\xe2\\x80\\x98tis less easy to laugh',\n",
       " '       The fiend strike me blue',\n",
       " ' I\\xe2\\x80\\x98m scarce able to walk,      And damn me if I can stand upright or talk',\n",

       " '      So lend me a hand;      I\\xe2\\x80\\x98m not able to stand,      But I\\xe2\\x80\\x98m gay whilst I linger on top of the land',\n",
       " '   About this time I conceived my present fear of fire and thunderstorms',\n",
       " ' Previously indifferent to such things, I had now an unspeakable horror of them; and would retire to the innermost recesses of the house whenever the heavens threatened an electrical display',\n",
       " ' A favourite haunt of mine during the day was the ruined cellar of the mansion that had burned down, and in fancy I would picture the structure as it had been in its prime',\n",
       " ' On one occasion I startled a villager by leading him confidently to a shallow sub-cellar, of whose existence I seemed to know in spite of the fact that it had been unseen and forgotten for many generations',\n",
       " ' At last came that which I had long feared',\n",
       " ' My parents, alarmed at the altered manner and appearance of their only son, commenced to exert over my movements a kindly espionage which threatened to result in disaster',\n",
       " ' I had told no one of my visits to the tomb, having guarded my secret purpose with religious zeal since childhood; but now I was forced to exercise care in threading the mazes of the wooded hollow, that I might throw off a possible pursuer',\n",
       " ' My key to the vault I kept suspended from a cord about my neck, its presence known only to me',\n",
       " ' I never carried out of the sepulchre any of the things I came upon whilst within its walls',\n",
       " ' One morning as I emerged from the damp tomb and fastened the chain of the portal with none too steady hand, I beheld in an adjacent thicket the dreaded face of a watcher',\n",
       " ' Surely the end was near; for my bower was discovered, and the objective of my nocturnal journeys revealed',\n",
       " ' The man did not accost me, so I hastened home in an effort to overhear what he might report to my careworn father',\n",
       " ' Were my sojourns beyond the chained door about to be proclaimed to the world',\n",
       " ' Imagine my delighted astonishment on hearing the spy inform my parent in a cautious whisper that I had spent the night in the bower outside the tomb; my sleep-filmed eyes fixed upon the crevice where the padlocked portal stood ajar',\n",
       " ' By what miracle had the watcher been thus deluded',\n",
       " ' I was now convinced that a supernatural agency protected me',\n",
       " ' Made bold by this heaven-sent circumstance, I began to resume perfect openness in going to the vault; confident that no one could witness my entrance',\n",
       " ' For a week I tasted to the full the joys of that charnel conviviality which I must not describe, when the thing happened, and I was borne away to this accursed abode of sorrow and monotony',\n",
       " ' \\x0cI should not have ventured out that night; for the taint of thunder was in the clouds, and a hellish phosphorescence rose from the rank swamp at the bottom of the hollow',\n",
       " ' The call of the dead, too, was different',\n",
       " ' Instead of the hillside tomb, it was the charred cellar on the crest of the slope whose presiding daemon beckoned to me with unseen fingers',\n",
       " ' As I emerged from an intervening grove upon the plain before the ruin, I beheld in the misty moonlight a thing I had always vaguely expected',\n",

       " ' His name, as given on the records, was Joe Slater, or Slaader, and his appearance was that of the typical denizen of the Catskill Mountain region; one of those strange, repellent scions of a primitive colonial peasant stock whose isolation for nearly three centuries in the hilly fastnesses of a little-travelled countryside has caused them to sink to a kind of barbaric degeneracy, rather than advance with their more fortunately placed brethren of the thickly settled districts',\n",

       " ' Though well above the middle stature, and of somewhat brawny frame, he was given an absurd appearance of harmless stupidity by the pale, sleepy blueness of his small watery eyes, the scantiness of his neglected and never- shaven growth of yellow beard, and the listless drooping of his heavy nether lip',\n",
       " ' His age was unknown, since among his kind neither family records nor permanent family ties exist; but from the baldness of his head in front, and from the decayed condition of his teeth, the head surgeon wrote him down as a man of about forty',\n",
       " ' From the medical and court documents we learned all that could be gathered of his case',\n",
       " ' This man, a vagabond, hunter, and trapper, had always been strange in the eyes of his primitive associates',\n",
       " ' He had habitually slept at night beyond the ordinary time, and upon waking would often talk of unknown things in a manner so bizarre as to inspire fear even in the hearts of an unimaginative populace',\n",
       " ' Not that his form of language was at all unusual, for he never spoke \\x0csave in the debased patois of his environment; but the tone and tenor of his utterances were of such mysterious wildness, that none might listen without apprehension',\n",
       " ' He himself was generally as terrified and baffled as his auditors, and within an hour after awakening would forget all that he had said, or at least all that had caused him to say what he did; relapsing into a bovine, half-amiable normality like that of the other hill-dwellers',\n",
       " ' As Slater grew older, it appeared, his matutinal aberrations had gradually increased in frequency and violence; till about a month before his arrival at the institution had occurred the shocking tragedy which caused his arrest by the authorities',\n",
       " ' One day near noon, after a profound sleep begun in a whiskey debauch at about five of the previous afternoon, the man had roused himself most suddenly; with ululations so horrible and unearthly that they brought several neighbours to his cabin\\xe2\\x80\\x94a filthy sty where he dwelt with a family as indescribable as himself',\n",
       " ' Rushing out into the snow, he had flung his arms aloft and commenced a series of leaps directly upward in the air; the while shouting his determination to reach some \\xe2\\x80\\x97big, big cabin with brightness in the roof and walls and floor, and the loud queer music far away\\xe2\\x80\\x98',\n",
       " ' As two men of moderate size sought to restrain him, he had struggled with maniacal force and fury, screaming of his desire and need to find and kill a certain \\xe2\\x80\\x97thing that shines and shakes and laughs\\xe2\\x80\\x98',\n",
       " ' At length, after temporarily felling one of his detainers with a sudden blow, he had flung himself upon the other in a daemoniac ecstasy of bloodthirstiness, shrieking fiendishly that he would \\xe2\\x80\\x97jump high in the air and burn his way through anything that stopped him\\xe2\\x80\\x98',\n",
       " ' Family and neighbours had now fled in a panic, and when the more courageous of them returned, Slater was gone, leaving behind an unrecognisable pulp-like thing that had been a living man but an hour before',\n",
       " ' None of the mountaineers had dared to pursue him, and it is likely that they would have welcomed his death from the cold; but when several mornings later they heard his screams from a distant ravine, they realised that he had somehow managed to survive, and that his removal in one way or another would be necessary',\n",
       " ' Then had followed an armed searching party, whose purpose (whatever it may have been originally) became that of a sheriff\\xe2\\x80\\x98s posse after one of the seldom popular state troopers had by accident observed, then questioned, and finally joined the seekers',\n",
       " ' On the third day Slater was found unconscious in the hollow of a tree, and taken to the nearest gaol; where alienists from Albany examined him as soon as his senses returned',\n",

       " ' He had awaked to find himself standing bloody-handed in the snow before his cabin, the mangled corpse of his neighbour Peter Slader at his feet',\n",
       " ' Horrified, he had taken to the woods in a vague effort to escape from the scene of what must have been his crime',\n",
       " ' Beyond these things he seemed to know nothing, nor could the expert questioning of his interrogators bring out a single additional fact',\n",
       " ' That night Slater slept quietly, and the next morning he wakened with no singular feature save a certain alteration of expression',\n",
       " ' Dr',\n",
       " ' Barnard, who had been watching the patient, thought he noticed in the pale blue eyes a certain gleam of peculiar quality; and in the flaccid lips an all but imperceptible tightening, as if of intelligent determination',\n",
       " ' But when questioned, Slater relapsed into the habitual vacancy of the mountaineer, and only reiterated what he had said on the preceding day',\n",
       " ' On the third morning occurred the first of the man\\xe2\\x80\\x98s mental attacks',\n",
       " ' After some show of uneasiness in sleep, he burst forth into a frenzy so powerful that the combined efforts of four men were needed to bind him in a strait-jacket',\n",
       " ' The alienists listened with keen attention to his words, since their curiosity had been aroused to a high pitch by the suggestive yet mostly conflicting and incoherent stories of his family and neighbours',\n",
       " ' Slater raved for upward of fifteen minutes, babbling in his backwoods dialect of great edifices of light, oceans of space, \\x0cstrange music, and shadowy mountains and valleys',\n",
       " ' But most of all did he dwell upon some mysterious blazing entity that shook and laughed and mocked at him',\n",
       " ' This vast, vague personality seemed to have done him a terrible wrong, and to kill it in triumphant revenge was his paramount desire',\n",
       " ' In order to reach it, he said, he would soar through abysses of emptiness, burning every obstacle that stood in his way',\n",
       " ' Thus ran his discourse, until with the greatest suddenness he ceased',\n",
       " ' The fire of madness died from his eyes, and in dull wonder he looked at his questioners and asked why he was bound',\n",
       " ' Dr',\n",
       " ' Barnard unbuckled the leathern harness and did not restore it till night, when he succeeded in persuading Slater to don it of his own volition, for his own good',\n",
       " ' The man had now admitted that he sometimes talked queerly, though he knew not why',\n",
       " ' Within a week two more attacks appeared, but from them the doctors learned little',\n",
       " ' On the source of Slater\\xe2\\x80\\x98s visions they speculated at length, for since he could neither read nor write, and had apparently never heard a legend or fairy tale, his gorgeous imagery was quite inexplicable',\n",
       " ' That it could not come from any known myth or romance was made especially clear by the fact that the unfortunate lunatic expressed himself only in his own simple manner',\n",
       " ' He raved of things he did not understand and could not interpret; things which he claimed to have experienced, but which he could not have learned through any normal or connected narration',\n",
       " ' The alienists soon agreed that abnormal dreams were the foundation of the trouble; dreams whose vividness could for a time completely dominate the waking mind of this basically inferior man',\n",
       " ' With due formality Slater was tried for murder, acquitted on the ground of insanity, and committed to the institution wherein I held so humble a post',\n",
       " ' I have said that I am a constant speculator concerning dream life, and from this you may judge of the eagerness with which I applied myself to the study of the new patient as soon as I had fully ascertained the facts of his case',\n",
       " ' He seemed to sense a certain friendliness in me; born no doubt of the interest I could not conceal, and the gentle manner in which I questioned him',\n",
       " ' Not that he ever recognised me during his attacks, when I hung breathlessly upon his chaotic but cosmic word-pictures; but he knew me in his quiet hours, when he would sit by his barred window weaving baskets of straw and willow, and perhaps pining for the mountain freedom he could never enjoy again',\n",
       " ' His family never called to see him; probably it had found another temporary head, after the manner of decadent mountain folk',\n",
       " ' By degrees I commenced to feel an overwhelming wonder at the mad and fantastic conceptions of Joe Slater',\n",
       " ' The man himself was pitiably inferior in mentality and language alike; but his glowing, titanic visions, though described in a barbarous and disjointed jargon, were assuredly things which only a superior or even exceptional brain could conceive',\n",
       " ' How, I often asked myself, could the stolid imagination of a Catskill degenerate conjure up sights whose very possession argued a lurking spark of genius',\n",
       " ' How could any backwoods dullard have gained so much as an idea of those glittering realms of supernal radiance and space about which Slater ranted in his furious delirium',\n",
       " ' More and more I inclined to the belief that in the pitiful personality who cringed before me lay the disordered nucleus of something beyond my comprehension; something infinitely beyond the comprehension of my more experienced but less imaginative medical and scientific colleagues',\n",
       " ' And yet I could extract nothing definite from the man',\n",
       " ' The sum of all my investigation was, that in a kind of semi-uncorporeal dream life Slater wandered or floated through resplendent and prodigious valleys, meadows, gardens, cities, and palaces of light; in a region unbounded and unknown to man',\n",
       " ' That there he was no peasant or degenerate, but a creature of importance and vivid life; moving proudly and dominantly, and checked only by a certain deadly enemy, who seemed to be a being of visible yet ethereal structure, and who did not \\x0cappear to be of human shape, since Slater never referred to it as a man, or as aught save a thing',\n",
       " ' This thing had done Slater some hideous but unnamed wrong, which the maniac (if maniac he were) yearned to avenge',\n",
       " ' From the manner in which Slater alluded to their dealings, I judged that he and the luminous thing had met on equal terms; that in his dream existence the man was himself a luminous thing of the same race as his enemy',\n",
       " ' This impression was sustained by his frequent references to flying through space and burning all that impeded his progress',\n",
       " ' Yet these conceptions were formulated in rustic words wholly inadequate to convey them, a circumstance which drove me to the conclusion that if a true dream-world indeed existed, oral language was not its medium for the transmission of thought',\n",
       " ' Could it be that the dream-soul inhabiting this inferior body was desperately struggling to speak things which the simple and halting tongue of dulness could not utter',\n",
       " ' Could it be that I was face to face with intellectual emanations which would explain the mystery if I could but learn to discover and read them',\n",
       " ' I did not tell the older physicians of these things, for middle age is sceptical, cynical, and disinclined to accept new ideas',\n",
       " ' Besides, the head of the institution had but lately warned me in his paternal way that I was overworking; that my mind needed a rest',\n",
       " ' It had long been my belief that human thought consists basically of atomic or molecular motion, convertible into ether waves of radiant energy like heat, light, and electricity',\n",
       " ' This belief had early led me to contemplate the possibility of telepathy or mental communication by means of suitable apparatus, and I had in my college days prepared a set of transmitting and receiving instruments somewhat similar to the cumbrous devices employed in wireless telegraphy at that crude, pre-radio period',\n",
       " ' These I had tested with a fellow-student; but achieving no result, had soon packed them away with other scientific odds and ends for possible future use',\n",
       " ' Now, in my intense desire to probe into the dream life of Joe Slater, I sought these instruments again; and spent several days in repairing them for action',\n",
       " ' When they were complete once more I missed no opportunity for their trial',\n",
       " ' At each outburst of Slater\\xe2\\x80\\x98s violence, I would fit the transmitter to his forehead and the receiver to my own; constantly making delicate adjustments for various hypothetical wave-lengths of intellectual energy',\n",
       " ' I had but little notion of how the thought-impressions would, if successfully conveyed, arouse an intelligent response in my brain; but I felt certain that I could detect and interpret them',\n",
       " ' Accordingly I continued my experiments, though informing no one of their nature',\n",

       " ' Blending with this display of palatial magnificence, or rather, supplanting it at times in kaleidoscopic rotation, were glimpses of wide plains and graceful valleys, high mountains and inviting grottoes; covered with every lovely attribute of scenery which my delighted eye could conceive of, yet formed wholly of some glowing, ethereal, plastic entity, which in consistency partook as much of spirit as of matter',\n",

       " ' The attachment which Romero manifested toward me was undoubtedly commenced through the quaint and ancient Hindoo ring which I wore when not engaged in active labour',\n",
       " ' Of its nature, and manner of coming into my possession, I cannot speak',\n",
       " ' It was my last link with a chapter of life forever closed, and I valued it highly',\n",
       " ' Soon I observed that the odd-looking Mexican was likewise interested; eyeing it with an expression that banished all suspicion of mere covetousness',\n",
       " ' Its hoary hieroglyphs seemed to stir some faint recollection in his untutored but active mind, though he could not possibly have beheld their like before',\n",
       " ' Within a few weeks after his advent, Romero was like a faithful servant to me; this notwithstanding the fact that I was myself but an ordinary miner',\n",
       " ' Our conversation was necessarily limited',\n",
       " ' He knew but a few words of English, while I found my Oxonian Spanish was something quite different from the patois of the peon of New Spain',\n",
       " ' The event which I am about to relate was unheralded by long premonitions',\n",
       " ' Though the man Romero had interested me, and though my ring had affected him peculiarly, I think that neither of us had any expectation of what was to follow when the great blast was set off',\n",
       " ' Geological considerations had dictated an extension of the mine directly downward from the deepest part of the subterranean area; and the belief of the Superintendent that only solid rock would be encountered, had led to the placing of a prodigious charge of dynamite',\n",
       " ' With this work Romero and I were not connected, wherefore our first knowledge of extraordinary conditions came from others',\n",
       " ' The charge, heavier perhaps than had been estimated, had seemed to shake the entire mountain',\n",
       " ' Windows in shanties on the slope outside were shattered by the shock, whilst miners throughout the nearer passages were knocked from their feet',\n",
       " ' Jewel Lake, which lay above the scene of action, heaved as in a tempest',\n",
       " ' Upon investigation it was seen that a new abyss yawned indefinitely below the seat of the blast; an abyss so monstrous that no handy line might fathom it, nor any lamp illuminate it',\n",
       " ' Baffled, the excavators sought a conference with the Superintendent, who ordered great lengths of rope to be taken to the pit, and spliced and lowered without cessation till a bottom might be discovered',\n",
       " ' Shortly afterward the pale-faced workmen apprised the Superintendent of their failure',\n",
       " ' Firmly though respectfully they signified their refusal to revisit the chasm, or indeed to work further in the mine until it might be sealed',\n",
       " ' Something beyond their experience was evidently confronting them, for so far as they could ascertain, the void below was infinite',\n",
       " ' The Superintendent did not reproach them',\n",
       " ' Instead, he pondered deeply, and made many plans for the following day',\n",
       " ' The night shift did not go on that evening',\n",
       " ' At two in the morning a lone coyote on the mountain began to howl dismally',\n",
       " ' From somewhere within the works a dog barked in answer; either to the coyote\\xe2\\x80\\x94or to something else',\n",

       " '\\xe2\\x80\\x96 And now I also heard; heard and shivered and without knowing why',\n",
       " ' Deep, deep, below me was a sound\\xe2\\x80\\x94a rhythm, just as the peon had said\\xe2\\x80\\x94which, though exceedingly faint, yet dominated even the dog, the coyote, and the increasing tempest',\n",
       " ' To seek to describe it were useless\\xe2\\x80\\x94for it was such that no description is possible',\n",
       " ' Perhaps it was like the pulsing of the engines far down in a great liner, as sensed from the deck, yet it was not so mechanical; not so devoid of the element of life and consciousness',\n",

       " '\\xe2\\x80\\x96  Suddenly Romero leaped from his bunk; pausing before me to gaze at the strange ring on my hand, which glistened queerly in every flash of lightning, and then staring intently in the direction of the mine shaft',\n",
       " ' I also rose, and both stood motionless for a time, straining our ears as the uncanny rhythm seemed more and more to take on a vital quality',\n",
       " ' Then without apparent volition we began to move toward the door, whose rattling in the gale held a comforting suggestion of earthly reality',\n",
       " ' The chanting in the depths\\xe2\\x80\\x94for such the sound now seemed to be\\xe2\\x80\\x94grew in volume and distinctness; and we felt irresistibly urged out into the storm and thence to the gaping blackness of the shaft',\n",
       " ' We encountered no living creature, for the men of the night shift had been released from duty, and were doubtless at the Dry Gulch settlement pouring sinister rumours into the ear of some drowsy bartender',\n",
       " ' From the watchman\\xe2\\x80\\x98s cabin, however, gleamed a small square of yellow light like a guardian eye',\n",
       " ' I dimly wondered how the rhythmic sound had affected the watchman; but Romero was moving more swiftly now, and I followed without pausing',\n",
       " ' As we descended the shaft, the sound beneath grew definitely composite',\n",
       " ' It struck me as horribly like a sort of Oriental ceremony, with beating of drums and chanting of many voices',\n",
       " ' I have, as you are aware, been much in India',\n",
       " ' Romero and I moved without material hesitancy through drifts and down ladders; ever toward the thing that allured us, yet ever with a pitifully helpless fear and reluctance',\n",
       " ' At one time I fancied I had gone mad\\xe2\\x80\\x94this was when, on wondering how our way was lighted in the absence of lamp or candle, I realised that the ancient ring on my finger was glowing with eerie radiance, diffusing a pallid lustre through the damp, heavy air around',\n",
       " ' It was without warning that Romero, after clambering down one of the many rude ladders, broke into a run and left me alone',\n",
       " ' Some new and wild note in the drumming and chanting, perceptible but slightly to me, had acted on him in startling fashion; and with a wild outcry he forged ahead unguided in the cavern\\xe2\\x80\\x98s gloom',\n",
       " ' I heard his repeated shrieks before me, as he stumbled awkwardly along the level places and scrambled madly down the rickety ladders',\n",
       " ' And frightened as I was, I yet retained enough of perception to note that his speech, when articulate, was not of any sort known to me',\n",
       " ' Harsh but impressive polysyllables had replaced the customary mixture of bad Spanish and worse English, and of these only the oft repeated cry \\xe2\\x80\\x95Huitzilopotchli\\xe2\\x80\\x9d seemed in the least familiar',\n",
       " ' Later I definitely placed that word in the works of a great historian\\xe2\\x80\\x94and shuddered when the association came to me',\n",

       " ' Out of the darkness immediately ahead burst a final shriek from the Mexican, which was joined by such a chorus of uncouth sound as I could never hear again and survive',\n",
       " ' In that moment it seemed as if all the hidden terrors and monstrosities of earth had become articulate in an effort to overwhelm the human race',\n",
       " ' Simultaneously the light from my ring was extinguished, and I saw a new light glimmering from lower space but a few yards ahead of me',\n",
       " ' I had arrived at the abyss, which was now redly aglow, and which had evidently swallowed up the unfortunate Romero',\n",
       " ' Advancing, I peered over the edge of that chasm which no line could fathom, and which was now a pandemonium of flickering flame and hideous uproar',\n",
       " ' At first I beheld nothing but a seething blur of luminosity; but then shapes, all infinitely distant, began to detach themselves from the confusion, and I saw\\xe2\\x80\\x94was it Juan Romero',\n",

       " ' When I awaked, I was safe in my bunk and the red glow of dawn was visible at the window',\n",
       " ' Some distance away the lifeless body of Juan Romero lay upon a table, surrounded by a group of men, including the camp doctor',\n",
       " ' The men were discussing the strange death of the Mexican as he lay asleep; a death seemingly connected in some way with the terrible bolt of lightning which had struck and shaken the mountain',\n",
       " ' No direct cause was evident, and an autopsy failed to shew any reason why Romero should not be living',\n",
       " ' Snatches of conversation indicated beyond a doubt that neither Romero nor I had left the bunkhouse during the night; that neither had been awake during the frightful storm which had passed over the Cactus range',\n",
       " ' That storm, said men who had ventured down the mine shaft, had caused extensive caving in, and had completely closed the deep abyss which had created so much apprehension the day before',\n",
       " ' When I asked the watchman what sounds he had heard prior to the mighty thunderbolt, he mentioned a coyote, a dog, and the snarling mountain wind\\xe2\\x80\\x94nothing more',\n",
       " ' Nor do I doubt his word',\n",
       " ' Upon the resumption of work Superintendent Arthur called on some especially dependable men to make a few investigations around the spot where the gulf had appeared',\n",
       " ' Though hardly eager, they obeyed; and a deep boring was made',\n",
       " ' Results were very curious',\n",
       " ' The roof of the void, as seen whilst it was open, was not by any means thick; yet now the drills of the investigators met what appeared to be a limitless extent of solid rock',\n",
       " ' Finding nothing else, not even gold, the Superintendent abandoned his attempts; but a perplexed look occasionally steals over his countenance as he sits thinking at his desk',\n",

       " ' Shortly after waking on that morning after the storm, I noticed the unaccountable absence of my Hindoo ring from my finger',\n",
       " ' I had prized it greatly, yet nevertheless felt a sensation of relief at its disappearance',\n",
       " ' If one of my fellow-miners appropriated it, he must have been quite clever in disposing of his booty, for despite advertisements and a police search the ring was never seen again',\n",
       " ' Somehow I doubt if it was stolen by mortal hands, for many strange things were taught me in India',\n",
       " ' My opinion of my whole experience varies from time to time',\n",
       " ' In broad daylight, and at most seasons I am apt to think the greater part of it a mere dream; but sometimes in the autumn, about two in the morning when winds and animals howl dismally, there comes from inconceivable depths below a damnable suggestion of rhythmical throbbing ',\n",

       " ' But more wonderful than the lore of old men and the lore of books is the secret lore of ocean',\n",
       " ' Blue, green, grey, white, or black; smooth, ruffled, or mountainous; that ocean is not silent',\n",
       " ' All my days have I watched it and listened to it, and I know it well',\n",
       " ' At first it told to me only the plain little tales of calm beaches and near ports, but with the years it grew more friendly and spoke of other things; of things more strange and more distant in space and in time',\n",
       " ' Sometimes at twilight the grey vapours of the horizon have parted to grant me glimpses of the ways beyond; and sometimes at night the deep waters of the sea have grown clear and phosphorescent, to grant me glimpses of the ways beneath',\n",
       " ' And these glimpses have been as often of the ways that were and the ways that might be, as of the ways that are; for ocean is more ancient than the mountains, and freighted with the memories and the dreams of Time',\n",
       " ' Out of the South it was that the White Ship used to come when the moon was full and high in the heavens',\n",
       " ' Out of the South it would glide very smoothly and silently over the sea',\n",
       " ' And whether the sea was rough or calm, and whether the wind was friendly or adverse, it would always glide smoothly and silently, its sails distant and its long strange tiers of oars moving rhythmically',\n",
       " ' One night I espied upon the deck a man, bearded and robed, and he seemed to beckon me to embark for fair unknown shores',\n",
       " ' Many times afterward I saw him under the full moon, and ever did he beckon me',\n",
       " ' Very brightly did the moon shine on the night I answered the call, and I walked out over the waters to the White Ship on a bridge of moonbeams',\n",
       " ' The man who had beckoned now spoke a welcome to me in a soft language I seemed to know well, and the hours were filled with soft songs of the oarsmen as we glided away into a mysterious South, golden with the glow of that full, mellow moon',\n",
       " ' And when the day dawned, rosy and effulgent, I beheld the green shore of far lands, bright and beautiful, and to me unknown',\n",
       " ' Up from the sea rose lordly terraces of verdure, tree- studded, and shewing here and there the gleaming white roofs and colonnades of strange temples',\n",
       " ' As we drew nearer the green shore the bearded man told me of that land, the Land of Zar, where dwell all the dreams and thoughts of beauty that come to men once and then are forgotten',\n",
       " ' And when I looked upon the terraces again I saw that what he said was true, for among the sights before me were many things I had once seen through the mists beyond the horizon and in the phosphorescent depths of ocean',\n",
       " ' There too were forms and fantasies more \\x0csplendid than any I had ever known; the visions of young poets who died in want before the world could learn of what they had seen and dreamed',\n",
       " ' But we did not set foot upon the sloping meadows of Zar, for it is told that he who treads them may nevermore return to his native shore',\n",
       " ' As the White Ship sailed silently away from the templed terraces of Zar, we beheld on the distant horizon ahead the spires of a mighty city; and the bearded man said to me: \\xe2\\x80\\x95This is Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders, wherein reside all those mysteries that man has striven in vain to fathom',\n",
       " '\\xe2\\x80\\x96 And I looked again, at closer range, and saw that the city was greater than any city I had known or dreamed of before',\n",
       " ' Into the sky the spires of its temples reached, so that no man might behold their peaks; and far back beyond the horizon stretched the grim, grey walls, over which one might spy only a few roofs, weird and ominous, yet adorned with rich friezes and alluring sculptures',\n",
       " ' I yearned mightily to enter this fascinating yet repellent city, and besought the bearded man to land me at the stone pier by the huge carven gate Akariel; but he gently denied my wish, saying: \\xe2\\x80\\x95Into Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders, many have passed but none returned',\n",
       " ' Therein walk only daemons and mad things that are no longer men, and the streets are white with the unburied bones of those who have looked upon the eidolon Lathi, that reigns over the city',\n",
       " '\\xe2\\x80\\x96 So the White Ship sailed on past the walls of Thalarion, and followed for many days a southward-flying bird, whose glossy plumage matched the sky out of which it had appeared',\n",
       " ' Then came we to a pleasant coast gay with blossoms of every hue, where as far inland as we could see basked lovely groves and radiant arbours beneath a meridian sun',\n",
       " ' From bowers beyond our view came bursts of song and snatches of lyric harmony, interspersed with faint laughter so delicious that I urged the rowers onward in my eagerness to reach the scene',\n",
       " ' And the bearded man spoke no word, but watched me as we approached the lily-lined shore',\n",
       " ' Suddenly a wind blowing from over the flowery meadows and leafy woods brought a scent at which I trembled',\n",
       " ' The wind grew stronger, and the air was filled with the lethal, charnel odour of plague-stricken towns and uncovered cemeteries',\n",
       " ' And as we sailed madly away from that damnable coast the bearded man spoke at last, saying: \\xe2\\x80\\x95This is Xura, the Land of Pleasures Unattained',\n",
       " '\\xe2\\x80\\x96 So once more the White Ship followed the bird of heaven, over warm blessed seas fanned by caressing, aromatic breezes',\n",
       " ' Day after day and night after night did we sail, and when the moon was full we would listen to soft songs of the oarsmen, sweet as on that distant night when we sailed away from my far native land',\n",
       " ' And it was by moonlight that we anchored at last in the harbour of Sona-Nyl, which is guarded by twin headlands of crystal that rise from the sea and meet in a resplendent arch',\n",
       " ' This is the Land of Fancy, and we walked to the verdant shore upon a golden bridge of moonbeams',\n",
       " ' In the Land of Sona-Nyl there is neither time nor space, neither suffering nor death; and there I dwelt for many aeons',\n",
       " ' Green are the groves and pastures, bright and fragrant the flowers, blue and musical the streams, clear and cool the fountains, and stately and gorgeous the temples, castles, and cities of Sona-Nyl',\n",
       " ' Of that land there is no bound, for beyond each vista of beauty rises another more beautiful',\n",
       " ' Over the countryside and amidst the splendour of cities rove at will the happy folk, of whom all are gifted with unmarred grace and unalloyed happiness',\n",
       " ' For the aeons that I dwelt there I wandered blissfully through gardens where quaint pagodas peep from pleasing clumps of bushes, and where the white walks are bordered with delicate blossoms',\n",
       " ' I climbed gentle hills from whose summits I could see entrancing panoramas of loveliness, with steepled towns nestling in verdant valleys, and with the golden domes of gigantic cities glittering on the infinitely distant horizon',\n",
       " ' And I viewed by \\x0cmoonlight the sparkling sea, the crystal headlands, and the placid harbour wherein lay anchored the White Ship',\n",
       " ' It was against the full moon one night in the immemorial year of Tharp that I saw outlined the beckoning form of the celestial bird, and felt the first stirrings of unrest',\n",
       " ' Then I spoke with the bearded man, and told him of my new yearnings to depart for remote Cathuria, which no man hath seen, but which all believe to lie beyond the basalt pillars of the West',\n",
       " ' It is the Land of Hope, and in it shine the perfect ideals of all that we know elsewhere; or at least so men relate',\n",
       " ' But the bearded man said to me: \\xe2\\x80\\x95Beware of those perilous seas wherein men say Cathuria lies',\n",
       " ' In Sona-Nyl there is no pain nor death, but who can tell what lies beyond the basalt pillars of the West',\n",
       " '\\xe2\\x80\\x96 Natheless at the next full moon I boarded the White Ship, and with the reluctant bearded man left the happy harbour for untravelled seas',\n",
       " ' And the bird of heaven flew before, and led us toward the basalt pillars of the West, but this time the oarsmen sang no soft songs under the full moon',\n",
       " ' In my mind I would often picture the unknown Land of Cathuria with its splendid groves and palaces, and would wonder what new delights there awaited me',\n",
       " ' \\xe2\\x80\\x95Cathuria,\\xe2\\x80\\x96 I would say to myself, \\xe2\\x80\\x95is the abode of gods and the land of unnumbered cities of gold',\n",
       " ' Its forests are of aloe and sandalwood, even as the fragrant groves of Camorin, and among the trees flutter gay birds sweet with song',\n",
       " ' On the green and flowery mountains of Cathuria stand temples of pink marble, rich with carven and painted glories, and having in their courtyards cool fountains of silver, where purl with ravishing music the scented waters that come from the grotto-born river Narg',\n",
       " ' And the cities of Cathuria are cinctured with golden walls, and their pavements also are of gold',\n",
       " ' In the gardens of these cities are strange orchids, and perfumed lakes whose beds are of coral and amber',\n",
       " ' At night the streets and the gardens are lit with gay lanthorns fashioned from the three-coloured shell of the tortoise, and here resound the soft notes of the singer and the lutanist',\n",
       " ' And the houses of the cities of Cathuria are all palaces, each built over a fragrant canal bearing the waters of the sacred Narg',\n",
       " ' Of marble and porphyry are the houses, and roofed with glittering gold that reflects the rays of the sun and enhances the splendour of the cities as blissful gods view them from the distant peaks',\n",
       " ' Fairest of all is the palace of the great monarch Dorieb, whom some say to be a demigod and others a god',\n",
       " ' High is the palace of Dorieb, and many are the turrets of marble upon its walls',\n",
       " ' In its wide halls many multitudes assemble, and here hang the trophies of the ages',\n",
       " ' And the roof is of pure gold, set upon tall pillars of ruby and azure, and having such carven figures of gods and heroes that he who looks up to those heights seems to gaze upon the living Olympus',\n",
       " ' And the floor of the palace is of glass, under which flow the cunningly lighted waters of the Narg, gay with gaudy fish not known beyond the bounds of lovely Cathuria',\n",
       " '\\xe2\\x80\\x96 Thus would I speak to myself of Cathuria, but ever would the bearded man warn me to turn back to the happy shores of Sona-Nyl; for Sona-Nyl is known of men, while none hath ever beheld Cathuria',\n",
       " ' And on the thirty-first day that we followed the bird, we beheld the basalt pillars of the West',\n",
       " ' Shrouded in mist they were, so that no man might peer beyond them or see their summits\\xe2\\x80\\x94 which indeed some say reach even to the heavens',\n",
       " ' And the bearded man again implored me to turn back, but I heeded him not; for from the mists beyond the basalt pillars I fancied there came the notes of singer and lutanist; sweeter than the sweetest songs of Sona-Nyl, and sounding mine own praises; the praises of me, who had voyaged far under the full moon and dwelt in the Land of Fancy',\n",
       " ' So to the sound of melody the White Ship sailed into the mist betwixt the basalt pillars of the West',\n",
       " ' And when the music ceased and the mist lifted, we beheld not the Land of Cathuria, but \\x0ca swift-rushing resistless sea, over which our helpless barque was borne toward some unknown goal',\n",
       " ' Soon to our ears came the distant thunder of falling waters, and to our eyes appeared on the far horizon ahead the titanic spray of a monstrous cataract, wherein the oceans of the world drop down to abysmal nothingness',\n",
       " ' Then did the bearded man say to me with tears on his cheek: \\xe2\\x80\\x95We have rejected the beautiful Land of Sona-Nyl, which we may never behold again',\n",
       " ' The gods are greater than men, and they have conquered',\n",
       " '\\xe2\\x80\\x96 And I closed my eyes before the crash that I knew would come, shutting out the sight of the celestial bird which flapped its mocking blue wings over the brink of the torrent',\n",
       " ' Out of that crash came darkness, and I heard the shrieking of men and of things which were not men',\n",
       " ' From the East tempestuous winds arose, and chilled me as I crouched on the slab of damp stone which had risen beneath my feet',\n",
       " ' Then as I heard another crash I opened my eyes and beheld myself upon the platform of that lighthouse from whence I had sailed so many aeons ago',\n",

       " ' Why the beings and the sculptures lingered so late in the world, even until the coming of men, none can tell; unless it was because the land of Mnar is very still, and remote from most other lands both of waking and of dream',\n",
       " ' As the men of Sarnath beheld more of the beings of Ib their hate grew, and it was not less because they found the beings weak, and soft as jelly to the touch of stones and spears and arrows',\n",
       " ' So one day the young warriors, the slingers and the spearmen and the bowmen, marched against Ib and slew all the inhabitants thereof, pushing the queer bodies into the lake with long spears, because they did not wish to touch them',\n",
       " ' And because they did not like the grey sculptured monoliths of Ib they cast these also into the lake; wondering from the greatness of the labour how ever the stones were brought from afar, as they must have been, since there is naught like them in all the land of Mnar or in the lands adjacent',\n",

       " ' With strange art were they builded, for no other city had houses like them; and travellers from Thraa and Ilarnek and Kadatheron marvelled at the shining domes wherewith they were surmounted',\n",
       " ' But more marvellous still were the palaces and the temples, and the gardens made by Zokkar the olden king',\n",
       " ' There were many palaces, the least of which were mightier than any in Thraa or Ilarnek or Kadatheron',\n",
       " ' So high were they that one within might sometimes fancy himself beneath only the sky; yet when lighted with torches dipt in the oil of Dothur their walls shewed vast paintings of kings and armies, of a splendour at once inspiring and stupefying to the beholder',\n",
       " ' Many were the pillars of the palaces, all of tinted marble, and carven into designs of surpassing beauty',\n",
       " ' And in most of the palaces the floors were mosaics of beryl and lapis-lazuli and sardonyx and carbuncle and other choice materials, so disposed that the beholder might fancy himself walking over beds of the rarest flowers',\n",

       " ' Sometimes the amphitheatres were flooded with water conveyed from the lake in mighty aqueducts, and then were enacted stirring sea-fights, or combats betwixt swimmers and deadly marine things',\n",

       " ' In summer the gardens were cooled with fresh odorous breezes skilfully wafted by fans, and in winter they were heated with concealed fires, so that in those gardens it was always spring',\n",
       " ' There ran little streams over bright pebbles, dividing meads of green and gardens of many hues, and spanned by a multitude of bridges',\n",

       " ' And they said that from their high tower they sometimes saw lights beneath the waters of the lake',\n",
       " ' But as many years passed without calamity even the priests laughed and cursed and joined in the orgies of the feasters',\n",
       " ' Indeed, had they not themselves, in their high tower, often performed the very ancient and secret rite in detestation of Bokrug, the water-lizard',\n",
       " ' And a thousand years of riches and delight passed over Sarnath, wonder of the world and pride of all mankind',\n",
       " ' Gorgeous beyond thought was the feast of the thousandth year of the destroying of Ib',\n",

       " ' Within his banquet-hall reclined Nargis-Hei, the king, drunken with ancient wine from the vaults of conquered Pnath, and surrounded by feasting nobles and hurrying slaves',\n",
       " ' There were eaten many strange delicacies at that feast; peacocks from the isles of Nariel in the Middle Ocean, young goats from the distant hills of Implan, heels of camels from the Bnazic desert, nuts and spices from Cydathrian groves, and pearls from wave-washed Mtal dissolved in the vinegar of Thraa',\n",
       " ' Of sauces there were an untold number, prepared by the subtlest cooks in all Mnar, and suited to the palate of every feaster',\n",
       " ' But most \\x0cprized of all the viands were the great fishes from the lake, each of vast size, and served up on golden platters set with rubies and diamonds',\n",
       " ' Whilst the king and his nobles feasted within the palace, and viewed the crowning dish as it awaited them on golden platters, others feasted elsewhere',\n",
       " ' In the tower of the great temple the priests held revels, and in pavilions without the walls the princes of neighbouring lands made merry',\n",
       " ' And it was the high-priest Gnai-Kah who first saw the shadows that descended from the gibbous moon into the lake, and the damnable green mists that arose from the lake to meet the moon and to shroud in a sinister haze the towers and the domes of fated Sarnath',\n",
       " ' Thereafter those in the towers and without the walls beheld strange lights on the water, and saw that the grey rock Akurion, which was wont to rear high above it near the shore, was almost submerged',\n",

       " ' Then, close to the hour of midnight, all the bronze gates of Sarnath burst open and emptied forth a frenzied throng that blackened the plain, so that all the visiting princes and travellers fled away in fright',\n",
       " ' For on the faces of this throng was writ a madness born of horror unendurable, and on their tongues were words so terrible that no hearer paused for proof',\n",
       " ' Men whose eyes were wild with fear shrieked aloud of the sight within the king\\xe2\\x80\\x98s banquet-hall, where through the windows were seen no longer the forms of Nargis-Hei and his nobles and slaves, but a horde of indescribable green voiceless things with bulging eyes, pouting, flabby lips, and curious ears; things which danced horribly, bearing in their paws golden platters set with rubies and diamonds containing uncouth flames',\n",
       " ' And the princes and travellers, as they fled from the doomed city of Sarnath on horses and camels and elephants, looked again upon the mist-begetting lake and saw the grey rock Akurion was quite submerged',\n",
       " ' Through all the land of Mnar and the lands adjacent spread the tales of those who had fled from Sarnath, and caravans sought that accursed city and its precious metals no more',\n",
       " ' It was long ere any traveller went thither, and even then only the brave and adventurous young men of distant Falona dared make the journey; adventurous young men of yellow hair and blue eyes, who are no kin to the men of Mnar',\n",

       "['     The opening scene of this tale took place in a little village on the southern coast of Cornwall',\n",
       " ' Treby (by that name we choose to designate a spot, whose true one, for several reasons, will not be given,) was, indeed, rather a hamlet than a village, although, being at the sea-side, there were two or three houses which, by dint of green paint and chintz curtains, pretended to give the accommodation of \"Apartments Furnished\" to the few bathers who, having heard of its cheapness, seclusion, and beauty, now and then resorted thither from the neighbouring towns',\n",
       " '  This part of Cornwall shares much of the peculiar and exquisite beauty which every Englishman knows adorns \"the sweet shire of Devon',\n",
       " '\" The hedges near Treby, like those round Dawlish and Torquay, are redolent with a thousand flowers: the neighbouring fields are prankt with all the colours of Flora,\\xe2\\x80\\x94its soft air,\\xe2\\x80\\x94the picturesque bay in which it stood, as it were, enshrined,\\xe2\\x80\\x94its red cliffs, and verdure reaching to the very verge of the tide,\\xe2\\x80\\x94all breathe the same festive and genial atmosphere',\n",
       " ' The cottages give the same promise of comfort, and are adorned by nature with more luxurious loveliness than the villas of the rich in a less happy climate',\n",
       " '  Treby was almost unknown; yet, whoever visited it might well prefer its sequestered beauties to many more renowned competitors',\n",
       " ' Situated in the depths of a little bay, it was sheltered on all sides by the cliffs',\n",
       " ' Just behind the hamlet the cliff made a break, forming a little ravine, in the depth of which ran a clear stream, on whose banks were spread the orchards of the villagers, whence they derived their chief wealth',\n",
       " ' Tangled bushes and luxuriant herbage diversified the cliffs, some of which were crowned by woods; and in \"every nook and coign of \\'vantage\" were to be seen and scented the glory of that coast\\xe2\\x80\\x94its exhaustless store of flowers',\n",
       " ' The village was, as has been said, in the depth of a bay; towards the east the coast rounded off with a broad sweep, forming a varied line of bay and headland: to the west a little promontory shot out abruptly, and at once closed in the view',\n",
       " ' This point of land was the peculiarity of Treby',\n",
       " ' The cliff that gave it its picturesque appearance was not high, but was remarkable for being crowned by the village church, with its slender spire',\n",
       " '  Long may it be before the village church-yard ceases to be in England a favoured spot\\xe2\\x80\\x94the home of rural and holy seclusion',\n",
       " ' At Treby it derived a new beauty, from its distance from the village, and the eminence on which it was placed, overlooking the wide ocean, the sands, the village itself, with its gardens, orchards, and gaily painted fields',\n",
       " ' From the church a straggling, steep, yet not impracticable path, led down to the sands; by way of the beach; indeed, the distance from the village to the church was scarcely more than half a mile; but no vehicle could approach, except by the higher road, which, following the line of coast, measured nearly two miles',\n",
       " ' The edifice itself, picturesque in its rustic simplicity, seemed at the distance to be embosomed in a neighbouring grove',\n",
       " ' There was no house, nor even cottage, near',\n",
       " ' The contiguous church-yard contained about two acres; a light, white paling surrounded it on three sides; on the fourth was a high wall, clothed thickly with ivy: the trees of the near wood overhung both wall and paling, except on the side of the cliff: the waving of their branches, the murmur of the tide, and the occasional scream of sea-fowl, were all the sounds that disturbed, or rather harmonized with, the repose and solitude of the spot',\n",
       " '  On Sunday, the inhabitants of several hamlets congregated here to attend divine service',\n",
       " ' Those of Treby usually approached by the beach, and the path of the cliff, the old and infirm only taking the longer, but more easy road',\n",
       " ' On every other day of the week, all was quiet, except when the hallowed precincts were visited by happy parents with a new-born babe, by bride and bridegroom hastening all gladly to enter on the joys and cares of life\\xe2\\x80\\x94or by the train of mourners who attended relation or friend to the last repose of the dead',\n",
       " '  The poor are not sentimental\\xe2\\x80\\x94and, except on Sunday, after evening service, when a mother might linger for a few moments near the fresh grave of a lately lost child\\xe2\\x80\\x94or, loitering among the rustic tombs, some of the elder peasants told tales of the feats of the dead companions of their youth, a race unequalled, so they said, by the generation around them',\n",
       " ' Save on that day, none ever visited or wandered among the graves, with the one exception of a child, who had early learned to mourn, yet whose infantine mind could scarcely understand the extent of the cause she had for tears',\n",
       " ' A little girl, unnoticed and alone, was wont, each evening, to trip over the sands\\xe2\\x80\\x94to scale, with light steps, the cliff, which was of no gigantic height, and then, unlatching the low, white gate, of the church-yard, to repair to one corner, where the boughs of the near trees shadowed over two graves\\xe2\\x80\\x94two graves, of which one only was distinguished by a simple head-stone, to commemorate the name of him who mouldered beneath',\n",
       " \" This tomb was inscribed to the memory of Edwin Raby, but the neighbouring and less honoured grave claimed more of the child's attention\\xe2\\x80\\x94for her mother lay beneath the unrecorded turf\",\n",
       " '  Beside this grassy hillock she would sit and talk to herself, and play, till, warned home by the twilight, she knelt and said her little prayer, and, with a \"Good night, mamma,\" took leave of a spot with which was associated the being whose caresses and love she called to mind, hoping that one day she might again enjoy them',\n",
       " ' Her appearance had much in it to invite remark, had there been any who cared to notice a poor little orphan',\n",
       " ' Her dress, in some of its parts, betokened that she belonged to the better classes of society; but she had no stockings, and her little feet peeped from the holes of her well-worn shoes',\n",
       " ' Her straw bonnet was dyed dark with sun and sea spray, and its blue ribbon faded',\n",
       " ' The child herself would, in any other spot, have attracted more attention than the incongruities of her attire',\n",
       " ' There is an expression of face which we name angelic, from its purity, its tenderness, and, so to speak, plaintive serenity, which we oftener see in young children than in persons of a more advanced age',\n",
       " ' And such was hers: her hair, of a light golden brown, was parted over a brow, fair and open as day: her eyes, deep set and earnest, were full of thought and tenderness: her complexion was pure and stainless, except by the roses that glowed in her cheek, while each vein could be traced on her temples, and you could almost mark the flow of the violet-coloured blood beneath: her mouth was the very nest of love: her serious look was at once fond and imploring; but when she smiled, it was as if sunshine broke out at once, warm and unclouded: her figure had the plumpness of infancy; but her tiny hands and feet, and tapering waist, denoted the faultless perfection of her form',\n",
       " ' She was about six years old\\xe2\\x80\\x94a friendless orphan, cast, thus young, pennyless on a thorny, stony-hearted world',\n",
       " '  Nearly two years previous, a gentleman, with his wife and little daughter, arrived at Treby, and took up his abode at one of the moderate priced lodging-houses before mentioned',\n",
       " ' The occasion of their visit was but too evident',\n",
       " ' The husband, Mr',\n",
       " ' Raby, was dying of a consumption',\n",
       " ' The family had migrated early in September, so to receive the full benefit of a mild winter in this favoured spot',\n",
       " ' It did not appear to those about him that he could live to see that winter',\n",
       " ' He was wasted to a shadow\\xe2\\x80\\x94the hectic in his cheek, the brightness of his eyes and the debility apparent in every movement, showed that disease was triumphing over the principles of life',\n",
       " ' Yet, contrary to every prognostic, he lived on from week to week, from month to month',\n",
       " ' Now he was said to be better\\xe2\\x80\\x94now worse\\xe2\\x80\\x94and thus a winter of extraordinary mildness was passed',\n",
       " ' But with the east winds of spring a great deterioration was visible',\n",
       " ' His invalid walks in the sun grew shorter, and then were exchanged for a few minutes passed sitting in his garden',\n",
       " ' Soon he was confined to his room\\xe2\\x80\\x94then to his bed',\n",
       " ' During the first week of a bleak, ungenial May, he died',\n",
       " '  The extreme affection that subsisted between the pair rendered his widow an object of interest even to the villagers',\n",
       " ' They were both young, and she was beautiful; and more beautiful was their offspring\\xe2\\x80\\x94the little girl we have mentioned\\xe2\\x80\\x94who, watched over and attended on by her mother, attracted admiration as well as interest, by the peculiar style of her childish, yet perfect loveliness',\n",
       " ' Every one wondered what the bereaved lady would do; and she, poor soul, wondered herself, and would sit watching the gambols of her child in an attitude of unutterable despondency, till the little girl, remarking the sadness of her mother, gave over playing to caress, and kiss her, and to bid her smile',\n",
       " \" At such a word the tears fell fast from the widow's eyes, and the frightened child joined her sobs and cries to hers\",\n",
       " '  Whatever might be the sorrows and difficulties of the unhappy lady, it was soon evident to all but herself, that her own life was a fragile tenure',\n",
       " ' She had attended on her husband with unwearied assiduity, and, added to bodily fatigue, was mental suffering; partly arising from anxiety and grief, and partly from the very virtues of the sufferer',\n",
       " ' He knew that he was dying, and tried to reconcile his wife to her anticipated loss',\n",
       " ' But his words, breathing the most passionate love and purest piety, seemed almost to call her also from the desolation to which he was leaving her, and to dissolve the ties that held her to earth',\n",
       " ' When he was gone, life possessed no one attraction except their child',\n",
       " ' Often while her father, with pathetic eloquence, tried to pour the balm of resignation, and hopes of eternal reunion, into his wife\\'s heart, she had sat on her mother\\'s knee, or on a little stool at her feet, and looked up, with her cherub face, a little perplexed, a little fearful, till, at some words of too plain and too dread an import, she sprung into her father\\'s arms, and clinging to his neck, amidst tears and sobs, cried out, \"You must not leave us, papa',\n",
       " ' you must stay\\xe2\\x80\\x94you shall not go away',\n",
       " '\"  Consumption, in all countries except our own, is considered a contagious disorder, and it too often proves such here',\n",
       " ' During her close attendance, Mrs',\n",
       " \" Raby had imbibed the seeds of the fatal malady, and grief, and a delicate texture of nerves, caused them to d'evelop with alarming rapidity\",\n",
       " ' Every one perceived this except herself',\n",
       " ' She thought that her indisposition sprung from over-fatigue and grief, but that repose would soon restore her; and each day, as her flesh wasted and her blood flowed more rapidly, she said, \"I shall be better to-morrow',\n",
       " '\" There was no one at Treby to advise or assist her',\n",
       " ' She was not one of those who make friends and intimates of all who fall in their way',\n",
       " ' She was gentle, considerate, courteous\\xe2\\x80\\x94but her refined mind shrunk from displaying its deep wounds to the vulgar and unfeeling',\n",
       " \"  After her husband's death she had written several letters, which she carefully put into the post-office herself\\xe2\\x80\\x94going on purpose to the nearest post town, three miles distant\",\n",
       " ' She had received one in answer, and it had the effect of increasing every fatal symptom, through the anguish and excessive agitation it excited',\n",
       " ' Sometimes she talked of leaving Treby, but she delayed till she should be better; which time, the villagers plainly saw, would never come, but they were not aware how awfully near the crisis really was',\n",
       " '  One morning\\xe2\\x80\\x94her husband had now been dead about four months\\xe2\\x80\\x94she called up the woman of the house in which she lodged; there was a smile on her face, and a pink spot burnt brightly in either cheek, while her brow was ashy pale; there was something ghastly in the very gladness her countenance expressed; yet she felt nothing of all this, but said, \"The newspaper you lent me had good news in it, Mrs',\n",
       " ' Baker',\n",
       " ' It tells me that a dear friend of mine is arrived in England, whom I thought still on the Continent',\n",
       " ' I am going to write to her',\n",
       " ' Will you let your daughter take my little girl a walk while I write',\n",
       " '\"  Mrs',\n",
       " ' Baker consented',\n",
       " ' The child was equipped and sent out, while her mother sat down to write',\n",
       " ' In about an hour she came out of her parlour; Mrs',\n",
       " ' Baker saw her going towards the garden; she tottered as she walked, so the woman hastened to her',\n",
       " ' \"Thank you,\" she said; \"I feel strangely faint\\xe2\\x80\\x94I had much to say, and that letter had unhinged me\\xe2\\x80\\x94I must finish it to-morrow\\xe2\\x80\\x94now the air will restore me\\xe2\\x80\\x94I can scarcely breathe',\n",
       " '\"  Mrs',\n",
       " ' Baker offered her arm',\n",
       " ' The sufferer walked faintly and feebly to a little bench, and, sitting down, supported herself by her companion',\n",
       " ' Her breath grew shorter; she murmured some words; Mrs',\n",
       " \" Baker bent down, but could catch only the name of her child, which was the last sound that hovered on the mother's lips\",\n",
       " ' With one sigh her heart ceased to beat, and life quitted her exhausted frame',\n",
       " ' The poor woman screamed loudly for help, as she felt her press heavily against her; and then, sliding from her seat, sink lifeless on the ground',\n",
       " '      Chapter 2      It was to Mrs',\n",
       " \" Baker's credit that she did not attempt to investigate the affairs of her hapless lodger till after the funeral\",\n",
       " ' A purse, containing twelve guineas, which she found on her table, served, indeed, to satisfy her that she would be no immediate loser',\n",
       " ' However, as soon as the sod covered the gentle form of the unfortunate lady, she proceeded to examine her papers',\n",
       " ' The first that presented itself was the unfinished letter which Mrs',\n",
       " ' Raby was engaged in writing at the time of her death',\n",
       " ' This promised information, and Mrs',\n",
       " ' Baker read it with eagerness',\n",
       " ' It was as follows:\\xe2\\x80\\x94  \"My dearest Friend,  \"A newspaper has just informed me that you are returned to England, while I still believed you to be, I know not where, on the Continent',\n",
       " ' Dearest girl, it is long since I have written, for I have been too sad, too uncertain about your movements, and too unwilling to cloud your happiness, by forcing you to remember one so miserable',\n",
       " ' My beloved friend, my schoolfellow, my benefactress; you will grieve to hear of my misfortunes, and it is selfish in me, even now, to intrude upon you with the tale; but, under heaven, I have no hope, except in my generous, my warm-hearted Alithea',\n",
       " ' Perhaps you have already heard of my disaster, and are aware that death has robbed me of the happiness which, under your kind fosterage, I had acquired and enjoyed',\n",
       " ' He is dead who was my all in this world, and but for one tie I should bless the day when I might be permitted to rest for ever beside him',\n",
       " '  \"I often wonder, dear Alithea, at the heedlessness and want of foresight with which I entered life',\n",
       " ' Doomed, through poverty and my orphan state, to earn my bread as a governess, my entrance on that irksome task was only delayed by my visit to you: then under your dear roof I saw and was beloved by Edwin; and his entreaties, and your encouragement, permitted my trembling heart to dream of\\xe2\\x80\\x94to possess happiness',\n",
       " \" Timidity of character made me shrink from my career: diffidence never allowed me to suppose that any one would interest themselves enough in me to raise the poor trembler from the ground, to shelter and protect her; and this kind of despondency rendered Edwin's love a new, glorious, and divine joy\",\n",
       " ' Yet, when I thought of his parents, I trembled\\xe2\\x80\\x94I could not bear to enter a family where I was to be regarded as an unwelcome intruder; yet Edwin was already an outcast\\xe2\\x80\\x94already father and brothers, every relation, had disowned him\\xe2\\x80\\x94and he, like I, was alone',\n",
       " ' And you, Alithea, how fondly, how sweetly did you encourage me\\xe2\\x80\\x94making that appear my duty which was the fulfilment of my wildest dreams of joy',\n",

       " ' Several presented themselves, who proved wholly unfit; and Falkner was made angry by their extortionate demands, and total incapacity',\n",

       " ' She was below the middle stature\\xe2\\x80\\x94spare, and upright in figure, with a composed countenance, and an appearance of tidiness and quiet that was quite novel, and by no means unpleasing, contrasted with the animated gestures, loud voices, and exaggerated protestations of the foreigners',\n",
       " '  \"I hear, sir,\" she began, \"that you are inquiring for an attendant to wait on Miss Falkner, during your journey to Vienna: I should be very glad if you would accept my services',\n",

       " '\"  \"On our arrival at Odessa, sir, the lady, who had no such notion before, insisted on converting me to her church; and because I refused, she used me, I may say, very ill; and, hiring a Greek girl, left me here quite destitute',\n",

       " '  \"I do not pretend to that,\" she replied; \"but I was born and brought up a Protestant\\xe2\\x80\\x94and I did not like to pretend to believe what I could not',\n",
       " '\"  Falkner was pleased with the answer, and looked more scrutinizingly on the applicant',\n",
       " ' She was not ugly\\xe2\\x80\\x94but slightly pitted with the small-pox\\xe2\\x80\\x94and with insignificant features; her mouth looked obstinate\\xe2\\x80\\x94and her light grey eyes, though very quick and intelligent, yet from their smallness, and the lids and brows being injured by the traces of the malady, did not redeem her countenance from an entirely common-place appearance, which might not disgust, but could not attract',\n",
       " '  \"Do you understand,\" asked Falkner, \"that I need a servant, and not a governess',\n",
       " ' I have no other attendant for my daughter; and you must not be above waiting on her as she has been accustomed',\n",

       " '\"  There was a simplicity, though a hardness in her manner, and an entire want of pretension or affectation that pleased Falkner',\n",

       " ' He had been accustomed, on all convenient occasions, to hire a profusion of masters; but this desultory sort of teaching did not inculcate those habits of industry and daily application which it is the best aim of education to promote',\n",
       " ' At the same time he much feared an improper female companion for the child, and had suffered a good deal of anxiety on account of the many changes he had been forced to make',\n",
       " ' He observed the lady before him narrowly\\xe2\\x80\\x94there was nothing prepossessing, but all seemed plain and unassuming; though formal, she was direct\\xe2\\x80\\x94her words few\\xe2\\x80\\x94her voice quiet and low, without being soft or constrained',\n",
       " ' He asked her what remuneration she would expect\\xe2\\x80\\x94she said that her present aim was to get to Vienna free of expense, and she did not expect much beyond\\xe2\\x80\\x94she had been accustomed to receive eighty pounds a year as governess, but as she was to serve Miss Falkner as maid, she would only ask twenty',\n",

       " '\"  She was acquiescent',\n",
       " ' She insisted, however, with much formality, that he should make inquiries concerning her from several respectable families at Odessa; otherwise, she said, he could not fitly recommend her to any other situation',\n",

       " ' Every one spoke of her in high terms, lauding her integrity and kindness of heart',\n",
       " ' \"Miss Jervis is the best creature in the world,\" said the wife of the French Consul; \"only she is English to the core\\xe2\\x80\\x94so precise, and formal, and silent, and quiet, and cold',\n",

       " ' After being so shamefully deserted, she might have lived in my house, or four or five others, doing nothing; but she chose to have pupils, and to earn money by teaching',\n",
       " ' This might have been merely for the sake of paying for her journey; but, besides this, we discovered that she supports some poor relation in England, and, while cast away here, she still remembered and sent remittances to one whom she thought in want',\n",
       " ' She has a heart of gold, though it does not shine',\n",
       " '\"  Pleased with this testimony, Falkner thought himself fortunate in securing her services, at the same time that he feared he should find her presence a considerable encumbrance',\n",
       " ' A servant was a cipher, but a governess must receive attention\\xe2\\x80\\x94she was an equal, who would perpetually form a third with him and Elizabeth',\n",

       " \" To be obliged to talk, when he wished to be silent; to listen to, and answer frivolous remarks; to know that at all times a stranger was there\\xe2\\x80\\x94all this seemed to him a gigantic evil; but it vanished after a few days' trial of their new companion's qualities\",\n",
       " \" Whatever Miss Jervis's latent virtues might be, she thought that the chief among them was to be  Content to dwell in decencies for ever\\xe2\\x80\\x94  her ambition was to be unimpeachably correct in conduct\",\n",
       " ' It a little jarred with her notions to be in the house of a single gentleman\\xe2\\x80\\x94but her desolate situation at Odessa allowed her no choice; and she tried to counterbalance the evil by seeing as little of her employer as possible',\n",
       " ' Brought up from childhood to her present occupation, she was moulded to its very form; and her thoughts never strayed beyond her theory of a good governess',\n",
       " ' Her methods were all straight forward\\xe2\\x80\\x94pointing steadily to one undisguised aim\\xe2\\x80\\x94no freak of imagination ever led her out of one hard, defined, unerratic line',\n",

       " ' To be diligent and conscientious in her task of teaching, was the sole virtue to which she pretended; and, possessed of much good sense, great integrity, and untiring industry, she succeeded beyond what could have been expected from one apparently so insignificant and taciturn',\n",
       " '  She was, at the beginning, limited very narrowly in the exercise of any authority over her pupil',\n",
       " ' She was obliged, therefore, to exert herself in winning influence, instead of controlling by reprimands',\n",
       " ' She took great pains to excite Elizabeth to learn; and once having gained her consent to apply to any particular study, she kept her to it with patience and perseverance; and the very zeal and diligence she displayed in teaching, made Elizabeth ashamed to repay her with an inattention that looked like ingratitude',\n",

       " ' His observation was keen, and his imagination fervid; but it was inborn, uncultivated, and unenriched by any vast stores of reading',\n",

       " ' Miss Jervis was much of the latter; but the two served to form Elizabeth to something better than either',\n",
       " ' She learned from Falkner the uses of learning: from Miss Jervis she acquired the thoughts and experience of other men',\n",
       " ' Like all young and ardent minds, which are capable of enthusiasm, she found infinite delight in the pages of ancient history: she read biography, and speedily found models for herself, whereby she measured her own thoughts and conduct, rectifying her defects, and aiming at that honour and generosity which made her heart beat, and cheeks glow, when narrated of others',\n",
       " '  There was another very prominent distinction between Falkner and the governess: it made a part of the system of the latter never to praise',\n",
       " ' All that she tasked her pupil to do, was a duty\\xe2\\x80\\x94when not done it was a deplorable fault\\xe2\\x80\\x94when executed, the duty was fulfilled, and she need not reproach herself,\\xe2\\x80\\x94that was all',\n",

       " ' She loved her protector the more for his fervid approbation\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was the crown of all his gifts\\xe2\\x80\\x94she wept sometimes only to remember his ardent expressions of approbation; but Miss Jervis inspired self-diffidence, and with it a stronger desire for improvement',\n",
       " ' Thus the sensibility of her nature was cultivated, while her conceit was checked; to feel that to be meritorious with Miss Jervis was impossible,\\xe2\\x80\\x94not to be faulty was an ambitious aim',\n",
       " ' She easily discovered that affection rather than discernment dictated the approbation of Falkner; and loved him better, but did not prize herself the more',\n",
       " '  He, indeed, was transported by the progress she made',\n",
       " ' Like most self-educated, or uneducated men, he had a prodigious respect for learning, and was easily deceived into thinking much of what was little: he felt elated when he found Elizabeth eager to recite the wonders recorded in history, and to delineate the characters of ancient heroes\\xe2\\x80\\x94narrating their achievements, and quoting their sayings',\n",
       " ' His imagination and keen spirit of observation were, at the same time, of the utmost use',\n",
       " ' He analyzed with discrimination the actions of her favourites\\xe2\\x80\\x94brought the experience of a mind full of passion and reflection to comment upon every subject, and taught her to refer each maxim and boasted virtue to her own sentiments and situation; thus to form a store of principle by which to direct her future life',\n",
       " '  Nor were these more masculine studies the only lessons of Miss Jervis\\xe2\\x80\\x94needlework entered into her plan of education, as well as the careful inculcation of habits of neatness and order; and thus Elizabeth escaped for ever the danger she had hitherto run of wanting those feminine qualities without which every woman must be unhappy\\xe2\\x80\\x94and, to a certain degree, unsexed',\n",
       " ' The governess, meanwhile, was the most unobtrusive of human beings',\n",

       " ' When stopping at inns, or when, on arriving at Constantinople, they became stationary, she was even less obtrusive',\n",
       " ' At first Falkner had deemed it proper to ask her to accompany them in their excursions and drives; but she was so alive to the impropriety of being seen with a gentleman, with only a young child for their companion, that she always preferred staying at home',\n",
       " ' After ranging a beautiful landscape, after enjoying the breezes of heaven and the sight of the finest views in the world, when Elizabeth returned, she always found her governess sitting in the same place, away from the window, (because, when in London, she had been told that it was not proper to look out of window,) even though the sublimest objects of nature were spread for her view; and employed on needlework, or the study of some language that might hereafter serve to raise her in the class of governesses',\n",

       " '\"  Falkner smiled at the desire to cure every evil that crossed her path, which is one of the sweetest illusions of youth, and asked, \"Has he no mother',\n",
       " '\"  \"No,\" replied Elizabeth, \"he is an orphan like me, and his father is worse than dead, as he is so inhuman',\n",
       " ' Oh',\n",
       " ' how I wish you would save him as you saved me',\n",
       " '\"  \"That, I am afraid, would be out of my power,\" said Falkner; \"yet, if you can make any acquaintance with him, and can bring him here, perhaps we may discover some method of serving him',\n",
       " '\"  For Falkner had, with all his sufferings and his faults, much of the Don Quixote about him, and never heard a story of oppression without forming a scheme to relieve the victim',\n",
       " ' On this permission, Elizabeth watched for some opportunity to become acquainted with the poor boy',\n",
       " ' But it was vain',\n",
       " ' Sometimes she saw him at a distance; but if walking in the same path, he turned off as soon as he saw her; or, if sitting down, he got up, and disappeared, as if by magic',\n",
       " ' Miss Jervis thought her endeavours by no means proper, and would give her no assistance',\n",
       " ' \"If any lady introduced him to you,\" she said, \"it would be very well; but, to run after a young gentleman, only because he looks unhappy, is very odd, and even wrong',\n",
       " '\"  Still Elizabeth persisted; she argued, that she did not want to know him herself, but that her father should be acquainted with him\\xe2\\x80\\x94and either induce his father to treat him better, or take him home to live with them',\n",
       " '  They lived at some distance from the baths, in a shady dell, whose sides, a little further on, were broken and abrupt',\n",
       " ' One afternoon, they were lingering not far from their house, when they heard a noise among the underwood and shrubs above them, as if some one was breaking his way through',\n",
       " ' \"It is he,\\xe2\\x80\\x94look',\n",
       " '\" cried Elizabeth; and there emerged from the covert, on to a more open, but still more precipitous path, the youth they had remarked: he was urging his horse, with wilful blindness to danger, down a declivity which the animal was unwilling to attempt',\n",
       " ' Falkner saw the danger, and was sure that the boy was unaware of how steep the path grew at the foot of the hill',\n",
       " \" He called out to him, but the lad did not heed his voice\\xe2\\x80\\x94in another minute the horse's feet slipped, the rider was thrown over his head, and the animal himself rolled over\",\n",
       " ' With a scream, Elizabeth sprang to the side of the fallen youth, but he rose without any appearance of great injury\\xe2\\x80\\x94or any complaint\\xe2\\x80\\x94evidently displeased at being observed: his sullen look merged into one of anxiety as he approached his fallen horse, whom, together with Falkner, he assisted to rise\\xe2\\x80\\x94the poor thing had fallen on a sharp point of a rock, and his side was cut and bleeding',\n",
       " ' The lad was now all activity, he rushed to the stream that watered the little dell, to procure water, which he brought in his hat to wash the wound; and as he did so, Elizabeth remarked to her father that he used only one hand, and that the other arm was surely hurt',\n",
       " ' Meanwhile Falkner had gazed on the boy with a mixture of admiration and pain',\n",
       " ' He was wondrously handsome; large, deep-set hazel eyes, shaded by long dark lashes\\xe2\\x80\\x94full at once of fire, and softness; a brow of extreme beauty, over which clustered a profusion of chesnut-coloured hair; an oval face; a person, light and graceful as a sculptured image\\xe2\\x80\\x94all this, added to an expression of gloom that amounted to sullenness, with which, despite the extreme refinement of his features, a certain fierceness even was mingled, formed a study a painter would have selected for a kind of ideal poetic sort of bandit stripling; but, besides this, there was resemblance, strange, and thrilling, that struck Falkner, and made him eye him with a painful curiosity',\n",
       " \" The lad spoke with fondness to his horse, and accepted the offer made that it should be taken to Falkner's stable, and looked to by his groom\",\n",
       " '  \"And you, too,\" said Elizabeth, \"you are in pain, you are hurt',\n",
       " '\"  \"That is nothing,\" said the youth; \"let me see that I have not killed this poor fellow\\xe2\\x80\\x94and I am not hurt to signify',\n",
       " '\"  Elizabeth felt by no means sure of this',\n",
       " ' And while the horse was carefully led home, and his wound visited, she sent a servant off for a surgeon, believing, in her own mind, that the stranger had broken his arm',\n",
       " ' She was not far wrong\\xe2\\x80\\x94he had dislocated his wrist',\n",
       " ' \"It were better had it been my neck,\" he muttered, as he yielded his hand to the gripe of the surgeon, nor did he seem to wince during the painful operation; far more annoyed was he by the eyes fixed upon him, and the questions asked\\xe2\\x80\\x94his manner, which had become mollified as he waited on his poor horse, resumed all its former repulsiveness; he looked like a young savage, surrounded by enemies whom he suspects, yet is unwilling to assail: and when his hand was bandaged, and his horse again and again recommended to the groom, he was about to take leave, with thanks that almost seemed reproaches, for having an obligation thrust on him, when Miss Jervis exclaimed, \"Surely I am not mistaken\\xe2\\x80\\x94are you not Master Neville',\n",
       " '\"  Falkner started as if a snake had glided across his path, while the youth, colouring to the very roots of his hair, and looking at her with a sort of rage at being thus in a matter detected, replied, \"My name is Neville',\n",
       " '\"  \"I thought so,\" said the other; \"I used to see you at Lady Glenfell\\'s',\n",
       " ' How is your father, Sir Boyvill',\n",
       " '\"  But the youth would answer to more; he darted at the questioner a look of fury, and rushed away',\n",
       " ' \"Poor fellow',\n",

       " '\"  \"Dearest father, are you ill',\n",
       " '\" cried Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x94for Falkner had turned ashy pale\\xe2\\x80\\x94but he commanded his voice to say that he was well, and left the room; a few minutes afterwards he had left the house, and, seeking the most secluded pathways, walked quickly on as if to escape from himself',\n",

       " ' Falkner knew that he was the cause of this evil',\n",
       " ' How different a life he had led, if his mother had lived',\n",

       " ' How tenderly she had reared him, how devotedly fond she was, Falkner too well knew; and tones and looks, half forgotten, were recalled vividly to his mind at the sight of this poor boy, wretched and desolate through his rashness',\n",

       " ' If ever they had recurred to her real situation, he had not been chary of expressions of indignation against the Raby family',\n",

       " ' mr',\n",
       " ' hensons scheme which at first was considered very feasible even by men of science was founded upon the principle of an inclined plane started from an eminence by an extrinsic force applied and continued by the revolution of impinging vanes in form and number resembling the vanes of a windmill',\n",
       " ' but in all the experiments made with models at the adelaide gallery it was found that the operation of these fans not only did not propel the machine but actually impeded its flight',\n",
       " ' the only propelling force it ever exhibited was the mere impetus acquired from the descent of the inclined plane and this impetus carried the machine farther when the vanes were at rest than when they were in motion   a fact which sufficiently demonstrates their inutility and in the absence of the propelling which was also the sustaining power the whole fabric would necessarily descend',\n",
       " ' this consideration led sir george cayley to think only of adapting a propeller to some machine having of itself an independent power of support  in a word to a balloon the idea however being novel or original with sir george only so far as regards the mode of its application to practice',\n",
       " ' he exhibited a model of his invention at the polytechnic institution',\n",
       " ' the propelling principle or power was here also applied to interrupted surfaces or vanes put in revolution',\n",
       " ' these vanes were four in number but were found entirely ineffectual in moving the balloon or in aiding its ascending power',\n",
       " ' the whole project was thus a complete failure',\n",
       " '     it was at this juncture that mr',\n",
       " ' monck mason whose voyage from dover to weilburg in the balloon nassau occasioned so much excitement in 1837 conceived the idea of employing the principle of the archimedean screw for the purpose of propulsion through the air  rightly attributing the failure of mr',\n",
       " ' hensons scheme and of sir george cayleys to the interruption of surface in the independent vanes',\n",
       " ' he made the first public experiment at williss rooms but afterward removed his model to the adelaide gallery',\n",
       " '     like sir george cayleys balloon his own was an ellipsoid',\n",
       " ' its length was thirteen feet six inches  height six feet eight inches',\n",
       " ' it contained about three hundred and twenty cubic feet of gas which if pure hydrogen would support twentyone pounds upon its first inflation before the gas has time to deteriorate or escape',\n",
       " ' the weight of the whole machine and apparatus was seventeen pounds  leaving about four pounds to spare',\n",
       " ' beneath the centre of the balloon was a frame of light wood about nine feet long and rigged on to the balloon itself with a network in the customary manner',\n",
       " ' from this framework was suspended a wicker basket or car',\n",
       " '  the screw consists of an axis of hollow brass tube eighteen inches in length through which upon a semispiral inclined at fifteen degrees pass a series of steel wire radii two feet long and thus projecting a foot on either side',\n",
       " ' these radii are connected at the outer extremities by two bands of flattened wire  the whole in this manner forming the framework of the screw which is completed by a covering of oiled silk cut into gores and tightened so as to present a tolerably uniform surface',\n",
       " ' at each end of its axis this screw is supported by pillars of hollow brass tube descending from the hoop',\n",
       " ' in the lower ends of these tubes are holes in which the pivots of the axis revolve',\n",
       " ' from the end of the axis which is next the car proceeds a shaft of steel connecting the screw with the pinion of a piece of spring machinery fixed in the car',\n",
       " ' by the operation of this spring the screw is made to revolve with great rapidity communicating a progressive motion to the whole',\n",
       " ' by means of the rudder the machine was readily turned in any direction',\n",
       " ' the spring was of great power compared with its dimensions being capable of raising forty five pounds upon a barrel of four inches diameter after the first turn and gradually increasing as it was wound up',\n",
       " ' it weighed altogether eight pounds six ounces',\n",
       " ' the rudder was a light frame of cane covered with silk shaped somewhat like a battledore and was about three feet long and at the widest one foot',\n",
       " ' its weight was about two ounces',\n",
       " ' it could be turned flat and directed upwards or downwards as well as to the right or left and thus enabled the aeronaut to transfer the resistance of the air which in an inclined position it must generate in its passage to any side upon which he might desire to act  thus determining the balloon in the opposite direction',\n",
       " '      this model which through want of time we have necessarily described in an imperfect manner was put in action at the adelaide gallery where it accomplished a velocity of five miles per hour although strange to say it excited very little interest in comparison with the previous complex machine of mr',\n",

       " '     the balloon is composed of silk varnished with the liquid gum caoutchouc',\n",
       " ' it is of vast dimensions containing more than 40000 cubic feet of gas but as coal gas was employed in place of the more expensive and inconvenient hydrogen the supporting power of the machine when fully inflated and immediately after inflation is not more than about 2500 pounds',\n",
       " ' the coal gas is not only much less costly but is easily procured and managed',\n",
       " '     for its introduction into common use for purposes of aerostation we are indebted to mr',\n",
       " ' charles green',\n",
       " ' up to his discovery the process of inflation was not only exceedingly expensive but uncertain',\n",
       " ' two and even three days have frequently been wasted in futile attempts to procure a sufficiency of hydrogen to fill a balloon from which it had great tendency to escape owing to its extreme subtlety and its affinity for the surrounding atmosphere',\n",
       " ' in a balloon sufficiently perfect to retain its contents of coalgas unaltered in quantity or amount for six months an equal quantity of hydrogen could not be maintained in equal purity for six weeks',\n",
       " '    the supporting power being estimated at 2500 pounds and the united weights of the party amounting only to about 1200 there was left a surplus of 1300 of which again 1200 was exhausted by ballast arranged in bags of different sizes with their respective weights marked upon them  by cordage barometers telescopes barrels containing provision for a fortnight watercasks cloaks carpetbags and various other indispensable matters including a coffeewarmer contrived for warming coffee by means of slacklime so as to dispense altogether with fire if it should be judged prudent to do so',\n",
       " ' all these articles with the exception of the ballast and a few trifles were suspended from the hoop overhead',\n",
       " ' the car is much smaller and lighter in proportion than the one appended to the model',\n",
       " ' it is formed of a light wicker and is wonderfully strong for so frail looking a machine',\n",
       " ' its rim is about four feet deep',\n",
       " ' the rudder is also very much larger in proportion than that of the model  and the screw is considerably smaller',\n",
       " ' the balloon is furnished besides with a grapnel and a guiderope  which latter is of the most indispensable importance',\n",
       " ' a few words in explanation will here be necessary for such of our readers as are not conversant with the details of aerostation',\n",
       " '      as soon as the balloon quits the earth it is subjected to the influence of many circumstances tending to create a difference in its weight augmenting or diminishing its ascending power',\n",
       " ' for example there may be a deposition of dew upon the silk to the extent even of several hundred pounds ballast has then to be thrown out or the machine may descend',\n",
       " ' this ballast being discarded and a clear sunshine evaporating the dew and at the same time expanding the gas in the silk the whole will again rapidly ascend',\n",
       " ' to check this ascent the only recourse is or rather was until mr',\n",
       " ' greens invention of the guiderope the permission of the escape of gas from the valve but in the loss of gas is a proportionate general loss of ascending power so that in a comparatively brief period the bestconstructed balloon must necessarily exhaust all its resources and come to the earth',\n",
       " ' this was the great obstacle to voyages of length',\n",
       " '     the guiderope remedies the difficulty in the simplest manner conceivable',\n",
       " ' it is merely a very long rope which is suffered to trail from the car and the effect of which is to prevent the balloon from changing its level in any material degree',\n",
       " ' if for example there should be a deposition of moisture upon the silk and the machine begins to descend in consequence there will be no necessity for discharging ballast to remedy the increase of weight for it is remedied or counteracted in an exactly just proportion by the deposit on the ground of just so much of the end of the rope as is necessary',\n",
       " ' if on the other hand any circumstances should cause undue levity and consequent ascent this levity is immediately counteracted by the additional weight of rope upraised from the earth',\n",
       " ' thus the balloon can neither ascend or descend except within very narrow limits and its resources either in gas or ballast remain comparatively unimpaired',\n",
       " ' when passing over an expanse of water it becomes necessary to employ small kegs of copper or wood filled with liquid ballast of a lighter nature than water',\n",
       " ' these float and serve all the purposes of a mere rope on land',\n",
       " ' another most important office of the guiderope is to point out the direction of the balloon',\n",
       " ' the rope drags either on land or sea while the balloon is free  the latter consequently is always in advance when any progress whatever is made  a comparison therefore by means of the compass of the relative positions of the two objects will always indicate the course',\n",
       " ' in the same way the angle formed by the rope with the vertical axis of the machine indicates the velocity',\n",
       " ' when there is no angle  in other words when the rope hangs perpendicularly the whole apparatus is stationary  but the larger the angle that is to say the farther the balloon precedes the end of the rope the greater the velocity and the converse',\n",
       " '     as the original design was to cross the british channel and alight as near paris as possible the voyagers had taken the precaution to prepare themselves with passports directed to all parts of the continent specifying the nature of the expedition as in the case of the nassau voyage and entitling the adventurers to exemption from the usual formalities of office  unexpected events however rendered these passports superfluous',\n",
